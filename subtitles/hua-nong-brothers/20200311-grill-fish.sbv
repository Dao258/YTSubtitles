# 华农兄弟：兄弟看我们半天没钓到，特意送来一鱼，烤起很香哦
# Huanong Brothers: Our buddy gives us a fish, as he sees us getting home empty-handed after spending a whole day fishing. We grill the fish and it smells really good!

0:00:00.140,0:00:02.100
# 大家好  很久都沒吃過肉啦
Hi everyone! We haven't had any meat for a long time.

0:00:02.520,0:00:04.780
# 拿個魚竿來  釣點魚回去烤
So I come with a fishing pole, to catch some fish and grill them.

0:00:05.320,0:00:06.500
# 不知道能不能釣得到  (註︰這裡如果用"I don't know if..."或"I wonder.."感覺會帶點否定，和他原意不太配合)
Let's see if we can catch any

0:00:08.320,0:00:10.100
# 魚都可以看的到  好多哇
I can see the fish already. There are a lot!

0:00:11.880,0:00:12.880
# 哎喲
Ayo!

0:00:15.980,0:00:17.020
# 都不咬鈎的
They don't bite the hook at all.

0:00:17.680,0:00:19.220
# 釣那麼久都還不咬鈎
I've been here for such a long time but no fish have ever bitten the hook.

0:00:21.720,0:00:23.740
# 你看  那麼菜葉子就是給個魚吃的
Look! Those veggie leaves are food for the fish.

0:00:25.000,0:00:26.220
# 下面還有鴨子哦
There are ducks down there too.

0:00:26.920,0:00:30.240
# 用魚鈎來鈎鴨子應該很好釣  一下子就可以釣得到
I think catching the ducks with the hook wouldn't take too much effort. A single pull is all what's needed.

0:00:44.480,0:00:46.380
# 可能姿勢不對哦
Is it because of my posture?

0:00:46.600,0:00:47.500
# 釣不到的
I can't catch any.

0:00:48.220,0:00:48.720
# 唉
Ey?

0:00:51.820,0:00:52.320
# 哦
Oh?

0:00:56.100,0:00:58.440
# 這個角落沒有魚的  我去那邊
There aren't any fish at this corner. I'm going to that,

0:00:58.780,0:00:59.820
# 那邊釣  (註︰「釣」字不譯了，譯了反而更怪，但上句刪去"side"字以保留不完整的感覺)
that side.

0:01:30.980,0:01:33.460
# 一條魚都沒釣到  魚鈎都不咬的
Not even a single fish. They didn't bite the hook at all.

0:01:33.620,0:01:35.860
# 下次我叫兄弟搞一隻鴨子來吃
Next time I'll ask my buddy to get me a duck.

0:01:36.120,0:01:37.320
# 下面那個鴨子
I mean the ducks down there.

0:01:37.540,0:01:38.160

A few days later

0:01:38.260,0:01:39.720

# 這把刀不是很利
This knife is not really that sharp.

0:02:29.660,0:02:32.160
# 拿的家里的水果刀  菜刀又不見了
This is my cutting knife. The kitchen knife is again nowhere to be found.

0:02:40.920,0:02:42.000
# 這邊也是
This side too.

0:02:58.260,0:02:59.000

# 可以啦

0:04:16.680,0:04:17.920
# 這個是醬油  (註︰其實這應該不是醬油，即不是用大豆釀制的，這應該是用小麥釀制的鮮露，但我不管他了，他怎說我怎譯)
This is soy sauce.
