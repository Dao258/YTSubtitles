# 我們拿到田裡面去種一些這紅象草來
Let's take it to the field and plant some red elephant grass.

0:02:19.700,0:02:21.900
# 我們這有幾棵  其它地方我都沒種
I have just a few here, and nowhere else.

0:02:22.620,0:02:24.720

# 原來就是一棵的  現在長那麼多
There was only one at the beginning. But now there are so many.

After planting all these this year,

0:02:50.360,0:02:52.340
# 幾百棵  幾千棵都出來啦
it might become hundreds, or thousands of them.

0:03:00.200,0:03:01.880

No running, kid!

0:03:01.920,0:03:03.100
# 還那麼小你就亂跑
You're still a kid but you're already running  here and there.

0:03:15.140,0:03:16.440
# 把這些丟到車上去
Let me throw all these onto the car.

0:03:24.420,0:03:27.180
# 你看  把它扛那麼個  荒地裡面去種
Look! I'm taking them to the abandoned field and have them planted there.

0:03:27.840,0:03:28.440
# 在前面
It's just in front of us.

0:03:40.600,0:03:42.940
# 這一片都是荒的  都是雜草
This whole area is abandoned. There are only weeds.

0:03:43.480,0:03:46.040
# 但是這個草長起來的話  這個雜草就會死掉的
But the weeds would die out once the grass starts growing.

0:03:47.680,0:03:49.160
# 種這個很簡單的  就這樣
Planting it is a no-brainer. That's it.

0:03:53.520,0:03:54.400
# 這幾節
These chunks,

0:03:55.720,0:03:57.360

If there's no soil,

# 把這個插下去就好啦
Stick it in, and it's done.

0:04:48.580,0:04:50.820

The elephant grass can also stabilize the soil and prevent it from being washed away.

0:04:51.000,0:04:53.400
# 這個大水一沖的話 有這個根話
The roots of the grass can catch the, well, the soil,

0:04:53.500,0:04:55.500

when the river overflows.

0:04:55.940,0:04:58.520
# 如果沒有這個的話  它就很容易把這個土掀掉
Without the roots, the soil would be easily peeled off,

0:04:58.680,0:04:59.560
# 沖到下面去
