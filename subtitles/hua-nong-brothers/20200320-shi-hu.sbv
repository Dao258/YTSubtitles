# 你看  這大片都是哦
Look! It's the whole area here.

0:00:18.080,0:00:21.160
# 棚子都爛啦  沒有管  裡面都是好多草啦
The sheds have already run-down. No one takes care of them anymore and they're now full of weed.

0:00:22.300,0:00:24.600
# 當初他們投了  好像應該有幾十萬吧
At that time, they have invested something like hundreds of thousands RMB.

0:00:26.180,0:00:27.160
# 就成這樣子啦
And that's how it looks now.

0:00:28.800,0:00:29.580
# 太浪費啦
What a waste!

0:00:31.700,0:00:33.720

0:00:52.440,0:00:55.780
# 這個就是鐵皮石斛哦  現在們他沒有管理好
These are the shi hu. But now, they're not taking care of them anymore.

0:00:56.420,0:00:57.260
# 他們太忙了
They might be too busy.

0:00:57.820,0:00:58.960
# 所以就搞成這
So it's now,

0:00:59.260,0:01:00.940
# 造成這樣子  葉子都不見啦

0:01:01.180,0:01:02.420
# 這個原本要分支的
In fact these need to be branched.

0:01:02.540,0:01:03.740
# 他們就分都沒分  就這樣
But they didn't do anything at all.

0:01:03.900,0:01:05.580
# 也沒有人管  雜草叢生
Nobody takes care of it. There's nothing but weed.

0:01:07.580,0:01:10.420
# 看一下  嘖嘖  那麼漂亮的東西都被他們
Look! My god! It's so pretty but they've,

0:01:11.120,0:01:12.660
# 被他們  這樣糟糟蹋了
they've simply ruined it.

0:01:14.080,0:01:15.700

0:01:38.060,0:01:40.720
# 來都來了  哪有空手回去的道理
I'm already here. Getting back empty-handed is never an option.

0:01:43.660,0:01:44.220
# 這個
I think,

0:01:44.680,0:01:46.840
# 應該太遠啦  在這裡不好管理
it's way too far. Managing this place takes too much effort.

0:01:47.740,0:01:48.360

# 這種很值錢的哦  以前很值錢的   現在我就不知道
The price is really good. At least it used to be good. But I have no ideas now.

A couple of years go, it was like,

0:02:11.780,0:02:13.280
