哈喽大家好
Hello everyone

前几天我跟我伯爷
I brought a lot soy sauce

我抱了很多那个酱油回来
with my uncle couple days ago

跟大家分享一些关于酱油的一些小知识
and shared with you some information about soy sauce

今天我来跟大家分享一下关于铁锅的小知识
Today I want to share with you guys some information about iron woks

噢哟 这个锅好重哦
This steel wok is really heavy

这个锅适不适合家里面用
Is this wok suitable for home use?

这个锅不适合我们家里用
Not good for us at home

我们家里用的三水锅
We use "sanshui wok" at home

就是这么大
It's this big

那种大锅
That type of big wok

像你这种锅我们农村煮猪食哪里要得嘛
In countryside, how can we use such woks to boil pig food?

一锅猪草一大摞
We use such a big bunch of vine as pig food

炒来吃这个也不得行
And this is not good for cooking

你这个重了 要很大的劳动力
This wok is too heavy, requires too much strength

没得劳动力还不得行还簸不转
Without streng people can't toss it

簸不转
Hard to toss

是嘛
Right?

我伯爷说了这个不适合农村里面炒菜
My uncle said this one isn't good for cooking in countryside

这种锅呢 只适合城市里面可以移动可以拿起来翻
It's only good in cities where we can hold it and toss

其实这个锅大家不知道的是
Actually 

这种锅其实也有2种
There are two variants of this wok

一种是平底
One is flat bottom wok

这个就是平底
This one is flat bottom wok

这个是平底锅
This is flat bottom wok

一种是圆底
One is round bottom

为什么有2种呢
Why there are two types of wok?

这个平底的话放在灶上面就比较稳
Flat bottom is more steady on a stove

但是这个圆底的
However, for this round bottom one

更适合拿起来翻
It's better to raise it and flip

更适合拿起来抛
Better to raise it and toss

其实这两个各有所长
The two types of wok have their own strengths

之前有很多粉丝也在问
A lot fans ask us about

就是这个锅怎么样去开
How to season a wok

问我涂层锅需不需要开锅
Does a coated pan need to be seasoned

其实我想说涂层锅不需要开锅
Actually coating pans don’t need seasoning

直接把它洗干净就可以了
Just clean it

如果是生铁锅的话就必须要开
But pig iron woks need to be seasoned

熟铁也需要去开一下
Wrought iron woks also need seasoning

如果熟铁上面有涂层的也不能开
If there's coating on wrought iron, don't season it

应为你一烧那个涂层就坏掉了
As long as you burn it, the coating is broken

然后今天跟大家分享一下这个锅
Today, we'll share with you guys

该怎么样去开
how to season a wok

开这个锅
Seasoning woks

还有一些保养还有维护
And also maintainence and caring

其实我们这个锅只要把它烧得冒烟就可以了
We just need to burn the wok until it smokes

烧到冒烟之后 我们不能马上弄冷水上去
After it smokes, we can't immediately add cold water for cooling

因为它有炸锅的风险
As otherwise the water may spill out

就是容易裂开
It may crack 

要让它温度凉下去
Let it cool down first

用手试一下
Feel it with your hand

把它凉下去了之后再用猪油来擦
Use pork fat to wipe it after cooling down

擦一遍就OK
You only need to wipe one time

好香哦
Smell good

安逸
Nice

这哈锅打饱牙祭了
Now this wok is well fed

嘿嘿打饱牙祭了
Hehe, well fed

嘿嘿
[laughters]

按下去滋它
Press it down and sear it

反过来也给它滋一哈
Flip it and wipe the other side 

我们第一次开锅的话把锅的反面也给它涂一下油
When seasoning for the first time, also grease the bottom side of the wok

生铁锅唯一不好的就是它要生锈
The only disadvantage of a pig iron wok is that it's easy to get rusty

生了锈之后就是把它烧热
If it's rusty, heat it up

烧热了用油来擦
And then wipe it with oil

那个锈自己就会掉了
Rust will be fall off by itself

你看这个锈我们用油直接把它擦掉了
Look, we used oil to wipe off the rust

这个油摸了是要安逸点看起来亮光光的
It does look better after greasing. It looks so shiny now

嗯
yeah

生铁锅就是这样的这个要拿油来给它涂满
You need to grease a pig iron wok like this

其实我们的粉丝从这两年关注我以来
For the past two years,

几乎每一天都有粉丝再问
almost on every day, my fans always ask me for

就是让我给他们推荐一款好一点的锅
recommendations of good woks

这个锅其实它好在什么地方呢
What's the advantage of this wok?

我想跟大家说的是这个锅用的材料就是我们农村土锅的那种材料
I mean, this wok uses the same materials as those rural woks in countryside

生铁直接把它压出来的
Directly made of pig iron after pressing

现在就是找到一个好一点厂家
We just found a good factory and made it

按照我的要求生产出了这么一款锅
based on my requirements

这款锅就像相当于是把农村里面的土灶
This type of wok is basically a normal countryside wok

把它缩小比例然后加上了这个把柄
shrunk in size and added with this handle

手柄 不是把柄
Yeah a handle

然后把这边耳朵加上这个得话就可以在自己自家里面就可以炒菜
If you add an "ear" to the other side, it can be used at home

再一个就是还有它的价格
And also the price of the wok

不贵
Not expensive

一百多块钱
A hundred yuan or so

还有就是这个锅 它的纹路
And see this texture of the wok

这个里面的纹路就跟我们农村烧的大锅的纹路是一样的
The texture inside the wok is the same as those big woks we use in the countryside.

这3口锅都是我亲手开的
I seasoned the 3 woks by myself

然后还有一些锅待会儿也会把它开出来
We will season some other woks later

然后看完我们这个视频的话可以在我们评论区互动一下
Please also leave your comments below

到时候随便送了吧
And we'll do a giveaway

就这3个锅
with these 3 woks

互动最高的粉丝就给它送掉
Giveaway to the most active fans

把这些也弄来上起
Let's also season these ones

把它开了
Get them done

这个还多稳当哦
Wow this is really stable

使劲车
Twist hard

哦 其实刚刚还有一点没有说
By the way, one thing I forgot

没给你们说这个锅
Forgot to tell you about woks

生铁锅要是长时间不用
If you don't use a pig iron wok for a long time

一定要用油把它涂满了再放起来
grease it completely and then store it

绝对不可以用洗洁精洗干净了再放
Don't ever wash it with detergent.

因为用洗洁精洗完之后的话它那个水会腐蚀这个锅
Because after washing with detergent, it will corrode this wok.

然后这个锅肯定会生锈
And this wok will be rusty for sure

可以了
Done
