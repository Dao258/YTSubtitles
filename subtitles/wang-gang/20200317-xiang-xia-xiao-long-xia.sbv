# 厨师长乡下分享烧：“10斤小龙虾”，小宽油过虾，只加啤酒不放水，味道一流

# Chef Wang teaches you how to cook 5kg village-style crayfish with beer.
# 简介
# 大家好，天气转暖也快到了吃小龙虾的季节，现在还不是最肥美的时间，但由于嘴馋还是买来10斤犒劳下家人。可能是由于刷10斤小龙虾实在是有些吃力，切青瓜的时候居然翻车，刀碰到了手，其实回想多年以前刚学厨的时候为了赶上大师傅的速度经常会碰到手，伤疤是厨师必须要经历的。大家如果在烹饪的过程中碰到手一定要及时处理，不仅仅是为了自己负责也是为了食客负责，当然还是希望大家可以永远都可以安安全全的。最后如果大家想看小龙虾具体的处理和烹饪教学可以看我之前的视频，链接在此：麻辣小龙虾 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGmPpeDbjBg 十三香小龙虾 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRawQBCkQ34&t=67s

# Hi everyone. It’s getting warm these days and it’s almost the crayfish season. Although it’s not the perfect time yet and the crayfish is still growing, we could not resist and got 5 kg of crayfish for my family. I spent so much energy on cleaning these crayfish that I even lost control of my knife and sliced myself. Well, that reminds me of my time as a student, when I often had to try very hard to catch up with my master. Naturally, these injuries are part of my learning experience to become a real chef. Having said that, it is very important that you take immediate care of the wound during cooking, which is important for yourself and your guests. Being careful and safe during cooking is always a priority. Lastly, if you want to learn more about detailed preparation and cooking tutorials, please check out my previous videos Sichuan spicy crayfish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGmPpeDbjBg Crayfish with Chinese 13-species mix https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRawQBCkQ34&t=67s
