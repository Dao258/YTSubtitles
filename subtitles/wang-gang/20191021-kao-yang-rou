【美食作家王刚】烤羊肉 - https://youtu.be/drnOZmhSNmI
Grill roasted Lamb

泡一下
Soak it.

泡过一会儿再来腌
We'll marinate after soaking for a while.

不要干醉了哈
Don't get drunk!

哦哟 这个酒
Whoah!  This wine

这个酒不得了
This wine is intense

这白酒
This is bai jiu (Chinese rice wine, very strong)

把这个羊肉腌几个小时
First we'll marinate it for a few hours

腌入了味
Until it absorbs the flavors

待会儿腌入味了之后就直接把它夹在架子里面直接烤
Once the flavor is absorbed we'll clamp the meat into these racks and grill.

腌它2-3个小时差不多
Marinate for about 2-3 hours

天下武功唯快不破
(Quote from Kung Fu Hustle's The Beast) "In the world of kung fu, speed determines the winner"

刀是什么刀
What kind of knife is this knife?

这是我专业的杀猪刀
This is my professional pork butcher knife!

我们先烤一波来试一下
We'll grill a round first to try it out.

说一下腌肉过程呗
Explain the process of marinating the meat!

这个还不简单
That's easdy!

就是这个肉砍出来了之后泡一下
So basically, after chopping the meat, soak it.

泡2-3个小时把血水泡出来
Soak for 2-3 hours to draw out the blood.

泡出来之后放盐、酱油、姜、葱
After soaking, add salt, soy sauce, ginger, green onions

就这样就OK
And then it's OK!

不用搞得太复杂
Don't need to make it too complicated

其实烤羊肉有的地方腌都不用腌也不用洗
Actually in terms of grilled lamb, some places don't even marinate, and don't wash/soak the meat either.

直接把肉弄上去烤
They just throw it straight on to the grill

来 打开我们这个架子
Let's open up the grill racks

哇噻
Wow!

肯定很好吃
I bet it'll be delicious

这个皮子都烤缩了
The skin has shrunken during grilling

怎么样
How is it?

嗯 好吃
Mmm, it's good

羊肉最好现杀现做
Lamb is best fresh slaughtered fresh prepped

没有羊的同学可以用兔子代替
If you don't have lamb you can substitute with rabbit

用猪代替
Or pork

用猪那成本更高哦
With pork it'll cost you a bit more!

哎呀
Aiya

这个汤不摆了
This soup, let's put it back (?)

现在我们这个烤羊肉也做完啦
Now we've finished making the grilled lamb

羊肉汤也做好啦
Lamb soup is also done

现在就烤一些蔬菜
We'll grill some vegetables

然后我们从早上8点多一直做到现在天黑
Also we've been cooking since 8am this morning up until sunset

从羊肉开始烤就一直吃吃到现在
And we've been eating since we started grilling the lamb

我们今天就拍到这里
Today we'll record up to here

我现在要继续吃
I'm gonna keep eating
