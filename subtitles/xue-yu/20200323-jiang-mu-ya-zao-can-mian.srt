# 简介
# 本期视频继续分享福建美食。在厦门同安隐藏着一家23年的盐鸭店，据说是厦门公认第一的盐鸭，来到这里正是上午，老板的伙计们正在将鸭子下入砂锅中，锅底是姜片，上部分是整只鸭子；一排排的砂锅很是壮观，足足摆了2间屋子，还有一间屋用来将鸭肉剪成大块，3间屋子都没有座位，一只姜母鸭66元，所有来的客人都必须打包带走吃！即使这样生意依然火爆！++第二家店是漳州的特色早餐卤面，18盆卤味摆一桌任选，猪皮、豆腐、猪脚、肉、卤蛋等等，早上吃这么一大碗，不长胖都没有道理！

# Continuing sharing Fujian cuisine. There’s a salt duck restaurant with 23 years of history hidden in Tongan, Xiamen. It is said that they have the best salt duck in the whole Xiamen area. I arrived at brunch hours, just as the cooks dumping the ducks into clay pots. The bottom of the pots was filled with sliced gingers and the upper part of the pot contained whole ducks. The lined pots filled two rooms. There’s another room used to cut the cooked ducks into pieces. No seats can be found in any of the three rooms. The ginger duck stew was sold at 66 yuan per duck and the guests can only order takeouts. But still, the restaurant is always filled with customers waiting for a bite of the duck.
# The second restaurant serves a special breakfast: noodles in gravy with eighteen kinds of braised toppings to add as you like --- pig skins, tofu, pig feet, meat, eggs, etc. With a big bowl of noodles every morning, there’s no chance to not get fat.
