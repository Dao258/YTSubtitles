#貴陽五花肉土豪吃法！壹鍋250斤只出30斤，賣價很貴，拌面吃很香
#Luxurious way to eat pork belly in Guiyang! Only 15kg of final products are made from 125kg of pork belly. Expensive, but perfect with noodles

#探寻世界最具烟火气息的美味，我是雪鱼。在贵州贵阳，有一种特别的美食叫做脆哨，是一种熬猪油时剩下的“油渣”，不管是用五花肉还是大肥肉，或是精瘦肉，经过巧手烹制，却变成了一道别致的黔中美味。这几天吃糯米饭、吃粉、吃面时候，里面都能找到或多或少的脆哨。由于熬一锅脆哨费事费力，通常想要2个师傅共同劳作2个小时，这样做出来的脆哨不仅味美，也更有传统意义。经营了30年的老店，熟客非常多，经常一天要做6大锅才能满足需求。
#I’m Xue Yu, in search for the best street food in the world
#There is a unique local specialty in Guiyang, Guizhou, called ‘Cui Shao’, which are the residues from making lard. No matter whether they are made from pork belly, pork fat or lean pork meat, with fine skills and expertise, Cui Shao has become a special delicacy in Central Guizhou. I can always find Cui Shao more or less in my dishes when I eat sticky rice, noodles or rice noodles in Guiyang recently. It requires 2 masters to collaboratively cook for 2 hours for every single pot of Cui Shao. Such effort not only guarantees the best flavour, but also is a homage to the tradition. Having been running for 30 years, the shop I visited today has so many return customers that sometimes it needs to make 6 pots of Cui Shao to meet the foodies’ demands.

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,800
#阿姨 还 还有一个问题

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,880
#他们说 脆哨调色是用酒酿
It’s said that fermented rice is used to colour Cui Shao

It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a cooking method like this

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,040
#我们不用酱油 为什么不用酱油呢
We don’t use soy sauce. Why not

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,880
#酱油它用起来 颜色会发褐
Because soy sauce will make Cui Shao turn brown

39
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,920
#发黑
And turn black

40

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,880
#不能够停歇 就是这么一直铲着脆哨
You can’t rest, and you have to keep stirring like this

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,680
#这边就是两个师傅 来回换着

#这刚才又放了一盆五花肉
Another basket of pork belly was just added

48
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,920

So, even now we have four baskets of pork belly in the pot

There are four big pots and one big bucket of Cui Shao right behind me

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,440
#它们是根据五花肉的肥瘦比例不同
They are divided by the proportion of the fat

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,760
#而进行划分的
In the pork belly

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
#五花肉肉片 100元一斤

We use fattier parts of pork to make Cui Shao

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,880
#软哨是五花的

With more than half of the oil gone, another pot of cold oil is added back
