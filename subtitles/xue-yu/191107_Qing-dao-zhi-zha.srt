# 一个问题：青岛到底是Qingdao还是Tsingtao?

#青岛大哥靠80斤五花肉做小吃，一斤118元，吃法土豪！一天卖5大锅
#Bro in Qingdao makes snacks from 80 jin of pork belly, selling at 118 yuan/jin!

#今天在山东青岛品尝特色美食——脂渣！它是采用猪五花肉，油炸而成。80斤大片的五花肉放入油锅中，
#油炸一小时出锅，最后只有18斤。大量油脂遗留在锅内，剩下的脂渣口感脆爽，一点不油腻。
#脂渣可以直接白口吃，也可以炖白菜吃。它是青岛人最喜欢的小吃之一。
#Today I tried a special snack, "Zhi zha" ("fat residual"), in Qingdao, Shandong. It's made from pork belly. Fried. 80 Jin (40 kg) of pork belly 
#is fried in a large pot for one hour, with only 18 Jin left. Most fat stays in the pot. The fried "Zhi zha" is crispy and not greasy at all.
#You can eat "Zhi zha" directly or cook it with cabbage. It's one of the most popular snacks in Qingdao.
