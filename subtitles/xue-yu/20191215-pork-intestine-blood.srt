# 来到福建同安，我找到了这里非常特色的小吃——大肠血！
# Arriving at Tong’an, Fujian, we found the specialty street food -- pork intestine blood!
#（看着重口，其实不然）
# (looks hardcore, but not actually)
# 类似的美食，我在河南内黄县，黑龙江哈尔滨都吃过。
# I’ve had similar food in Neihuang, Henan and Harbin, Heilongjiang.
# 这家店由大叔和儿子经营，大概有37年了，
# The uncle and his son have run this shop for 37 years.
# 而且店里只有这一道硬菜！
# Besides, this is the only dish in the shop.
# 大肠血，顾名思义就是猪大肠里灌猪血，
# Pork intestine blood is literally pork blood stuffed in pork intestine.
# 大叔会在每天的凌晨3点去市场采购新鲜的材料，回来后开始制作，
# The uncle goes to market at 3am everyday to buy fresh ingredients, and starts cooking after coming back.
# 在早上7点半开始售卖，价格是20元一碗，
# They open at 7:30am, and the price is 20 yuan for a bowl.
# 都是直接当饭吃，顾客每人一碗！
# Every customer gets a bowl, which is already a meal!
# 别看店小，名气可是很大，
# Despite being a small shop, the fame is big.
# 很多周边城市的顾客都会慕名而来，
# Many people from nearby cities come for it,
# 厦门、泉州、漳州的顾客最多。
# and most of them are from Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou
# 一天差不多要4锅汤，生意真的很棒。
# The business is really good, as they sell four big pots of food every day.
