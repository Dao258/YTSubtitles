# 标题：广东炖汤架势真大！40个大煲塞满料，3小时不停火，闻味就想喝
# Various Soups served in large pots in Guangdong! Aromatic and delicious!
# 简介：“宁可食无肉，不可食无汤”，这次终于能来来广东喝汤了。去的地方是佛山一家农汤老店，这里是用瓦罐来煲汤，他们会根据不同时节变化汤里的食材，应时喝汤，并且汤都不会是很重的味道。每一煲汤都是在炭火炉子上熬制的，3个小时不停火才能熬制出来，里面的各种食材都被炖得很烂乎，汤色奶白，喝起来鲜香甜口，让人回味无穷。
# There is a saying that you can have a meal without meat but soup is essential.
