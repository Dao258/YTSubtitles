00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
# 尤其是锅的内壁上
Especially on the inner side of the pot

80
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,040
# 还是黄鳝比较好吃
So it’s still the eel that’s more tasty

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,400
# 黄鳝都是这种大骨头 硬骨头

# 每次吃煲仔饭的时候 这个砂锅比较大嘛
Every time having baozaifan… You know, the pot is big

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,760

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,080
# 你会感觉到 脸就像做桑拿一样
I feel like my face is having a sauna

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,880

because of the heat remaining in it

91
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,080
# 越吃感觉脸越热

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
# 您好 吃饭现在得拼桌了
“Hello, you have to share a table with other customers at the moment”
