# 广东牛奶吃法真多变！把牛奶捏成纸片厚，配粥配面，比咸菜还下饭
# So many ways to enjoy milk in Guangdong! Paper-thick milk flakes!

# 我是雪鱼，带你一起踏上寻味之旅。
# This is Xueyu, your guide on the food scouting tour.
# 顺德有一条街叫做金榜街，街道非常窄，
# There a very narrow street in Shunde named Jinbang Street,
# 3个人并排走会非常困难，
# which doesn't even allow three people walking side by side.
# 就是这样隐蔽的地方，聚集着很多牛乳牛奶店，而且它们都已经有几十年的历史了。
# Yet, there are many decades-old milk restaurants hidden here.
# 我来到的霞姐牛奶店，店铺不大，
# We visit a small restaurant run by Xia-Jie.
# 霞姐一个人在忙活着做牛乳片，
# Xia-Jie is busy making milk flakes alone,
# 旁边摆放着新鲜的水牛奶、醋、盐水，
# with fresh water buffalo milk, vinegar and salt water by her side.
# 依靠这样简单的工具，
# With such simple tools,
# 霞姐重复着将牛奶变成乳片的动作。
# Xia-Jie keeps making milk into flakes.
# 我在这里点了双皮奶、姜撞奶，9元一份，
# We ordered "Shuang Pi Nai" ("double skin milk") and "Jiang Zhuang Nai" ("ginger milk"), which cost 9 yuan each.
# 奶皮顺滑，奶香十足，
# The milk skin is smooth, while the milk is strongly flavorful.
# 走的时候还带了一瓶水牛奶。
# We also bought a bottle of water buffalo milk when leaving.
# 其实最让人意外的是牛乳片，味道是咸的，
# What surprised us the most are the milk flakes, which are salty.
# 当地人一般是泡茶、煮粥喝，比咸菜还下饭！
# Locals usually have then in tea or congee, which works better than pickles!
# 由于条件限制，我没有体验牛乳片的味道。
# Due to some limitations, I didn't try the milk flakes.

# 牛奶加白醋会凝固
Milk coagulates with vinegar

# 阿姨 这里面放的是盐水吗

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,440
# 就是因为盐水 我觉得才能够浮起来
I guess it has to be salt water, so that (the flakes) can float

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,200

This one is "Shuang Pi Nai" ("double skin milk")

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,000
# 我们看看这是双皮奶
Let's take a look. This is "Shuang Pi Nai"

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,720
# 它（姜撞奶）相对来说 还能够晃动
Comparatively, this "Jiang Shuang Nai" can shake a bit

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,200
# 但是这个（双皮奶）就像果冻一样
However, this "Shuang Pi Nai" is like a jelly

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,360
# 没有那么容易晃动
Not that easy to shake

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,080
# 而且双皮奶表面是有褶皱的
And there are wrinkles on the surface of "Shuang Pi Nai"

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,640
# 这个的表面看上去就是光滑很多

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,080

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,280
# 吃一口就是浓重的姜的味道
Have a bite, and there's a strong gingery scent in your mouth

On the other hand, "Shuang Pi Nai" is just strong milky flavor

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
# 双皮奶里面是加了蛋清和糖的
There are egg white and sugar added into "Shuang Pi Nai"

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
# 所以吃起来会更香
So it tastes even better

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,040
# 吃完姜撞奶 你会感觉 浑身发热
After having the "Jiang Zhuang Nai", you may find your whole body heating up

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,600
# 走的时候又买了一瓶水牛奶
Before leaving, we bought a bottle of water buffalo milk

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,720

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,680
# 奶味会比普通咱们喝的这些牌子的牛奶
It has a much stronger milky flavor

88
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,320
# 奶味要重很多
compared to the regular branded milk

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,760
# 不过这次买的牛奶 它的保质期很短
However, the buffalo milk didn't stay long

90
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,800
# 第二天早上 它就变酸了
In the next morning, it went sour

91
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,680
# 挑战做双皮奶

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,560
# 加热 但是不要沸腾
Heat, but don't boil

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,040
# 我们用筷子挡一下奶皮
We block the milk skin with chopsticks

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,320
# 把牛奶倒进去
and pour the milk in

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,720
# 这样 碗底就有奶皮了
In this way, there's milk skin at the bottom of the bowl

98
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,520
# 加蛋清 白糖
Add egg white and sugar

99
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,080
# 原来以为是一个教程
I thought it would be a tutorial

103
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,680
# 没想到 它是一个事故
Didn't expect it ended up an accident

104
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
# 好像不太凝固
It doesn't seem quite coagulated

105
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,880
# 一般我们在店里吃的双皮奶都是凉的
Normally, the "Shuang Pi Nai" we have at restaurants is cool

106
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,440

Or at most warm

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,000
# 这个 现在是烫的
It's quite hot at the moment

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,360
# 咱们凉一会儿再吃吧
Let's wait for it to cool down

109
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,040
# 还是很烫的
It's still pretty hot

110
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,280
# 来 试一试我的大作
Come one, have a try of my masterpiece

111

# 不知道它有没有成功
Not sure if it's successful or not

112
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,640
# 反正 样子是有了
Anyway, it looks correct

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
# 因为我没有加很多糖
As I didn't add a lot of sugar

114
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
# 所以它吃起来没有那么甜
it doesn't taste as sweet

115
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,840
# 但是依然有很重的奶香味
Still, there's a very strong milky flavor

116
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
# 味道还是不错的
The taste is not bad

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
