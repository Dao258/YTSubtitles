Just more rice

9 
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,280

18 
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,440
#加了1块钱的绿豆蓉

19 
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,400
#你像糯米饭是软软糯糯的 对不对
Generally glutinous rice is soft and sticky, right?

20 
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
#咱们一摸起来就是 很软
You can feel the softness as soon as you touch it

21 
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,920
#但是这个东西 刚才我摸的时候
But this one... when I touched it just now

22

#它会有点硬
It was somewhat hard

23 
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,760
#我没想到 竟然是 妙脆角
I didn't expect it was Bugles actually

24 
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,200
#糯米饭 其实和我的拳头差不多大

#外面是 油亮油亮的
The outside looks oily and shiny

26 
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,240
#以前吃的 大多数都是甜的
In the past, most of the glutinous rice that I had was sweet

27 
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,560
#这次咱们尝试一下 辣的
This time let's try a spicy one

28 
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,280
#刚才可能是因为我吃到绿豆蓉
Perhaps it was because I bit the mung bean paste just now

29 
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,600
#真的是很奇妙
It tasted surprising

30 
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,080
#这个糯米饭整体是 咸辣香的口感
The overall tastes are salty and spicy

31

#但是绿豆蓉是比较细腻的
But the mung bean paste is delicate

33 
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
#带有微微的的甜味
with slight sweetness

34 
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,880
#和咸味并不是很冲突
It doesn't conflict much with the salty taste

35 
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,800
#因为糯米饭当中加了一些香肠
Since there is some sausage in the rice

36 
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
#而且香肠还有一些油放进去
the sausage comes with oil

37 
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
#所以糯米饭吃起来一点都不会干
The rice ball is not dry at all

38 
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,520

But there is a problem

#吃第一口的时候会觉得很香 很辣
When you take the first bite, you'll feel it delicious and spicy

But if you eat too much, you'll feel it's greasy

#这个量当主食吃 当一顿饭吃
The rice ball may not

42 
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,960
#可能量不太够
be enough for a meal

43 
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,680
#站在江边 当个小零食吃 就差不多
But it's Ok to have one as a snack as you stand by the riverside

44 
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,080
#从最开始到现在 一直都是我在做
I've been cooking this from the very beginning till now

45 
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,200
#开始 刚做 我还没会做
In the beginning, I didn't know how to cook it

46 
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
#糯米 蒸也蒸不熟
I couldn't even steam the glutinous rice properly

47 
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,600
#蒸不熟 不会蒸
The rice was not steamed well because I couldn't do it

48 
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
#不懂什么叫蒸熟
I didn't know to what extent it was steamed well

49 
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,400
#做了多久的糯米饭
How long had you been trying

50 
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,200
#才开始能够蒸熟糯米饭
before you could steam it well?

51 
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
#反正自己慢慢地摸索
Anyway, I slowly explored it

52 
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,880
#什么叫熟
and understood what is "steamed well"

53 
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,800
#这些调料 比如说香肠末还有牛肉丸子
These ingredients.. Such as sausage dices and beef ball

54 
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,760
#都是自己想的 应该放什么吗
Did you come up with what to put in the rice ball by yourself?

55 
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,960
#反正我是乱搞的
Actually I tried randomly

56 
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,120
#一时一个名堂
I change them from time to time

57 
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,400
#反正搞了 人家说好吃就可以了
As long as my customers like it

58 
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,040
#我也不管它是什么样 难不难看 我不管
I don't really care how it looks, or if it's ugly

59 
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,680
#你只要说 好吃
As long as you say "it's delicious!"

60 
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,640
#就可以
That's fine

61 
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
#阿姨 我问一个问题就是

73

#阿姨这个饭比你还要重
Auntie, the rice is even heavier than yourself

77

#阿姨说 原来还能抬得动糯米饭
The auntie said that she could lift it by herself in the past

78 
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,240
#现在已经抬不动了
But not anymore

79 
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
#一方面是她太瘦 另一方面是这饭太重
On the one hand, she is too thin. On the other hand, the rice is too heavy

80

#这样脸好像更肥嘟嘟一些
My cheeks look chubby in this way
