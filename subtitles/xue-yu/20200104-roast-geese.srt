# 上面这个冷气

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,960
# 有专门的设施
It’s specially designed.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,880
# 我们是自己研发出来的（这种做法）
We figured out (this method) on our own.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,320
# 冷气风干
Drying with air-conditioner.

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,280
# 一般烧鹅如果没有进行风干处理的话
If the geese are not dried before being roasted

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,280
# 猜测意思：再出去 外面温度35度 36度
(I guess he means) And then you go out. It’s 35 or 36 degrees outside.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,600
# 我这里零下2度 这个不一样的
Here, it’s -2 degrees. It’s completely different.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,720
# 如果这样搞（进行风干处理）呢
Our method (to dry)

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
# 有什么好处
has the advantage.

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,080
# 出去外面 温度都很高
The temperature is really high outside.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,600
# 你却把这个鹅皮搞干了
But you dry the skin of the geese.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,120
# 里面的肉就变了
The meat may be rotten.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,160
# 所以 我们用这个冷气风干
That’s why we dry with the air-conditioner.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,800
# 这样 鹅烧出来皮好吃一点
Then the roast geese will have a more tasty skin.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,620
# 就是口感会更好

00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,640
# 烧出来这个皮就很脆了
It would become really crispy after roasting.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
# 所以 风干后做出来口感会比较好
So the texture is much better if it’s dried first.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
# 一般做烧鹅 没有这个流程
Other roast geese do not go through this step.

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
# 没有这个流程的话 皮可能就没有那么脆
The skin won’t be that crispy without this stel.

# 懂了吗 这个风干就是为了让鹅皮更脆一些
Got it? Drying it is for a more crispy skin.
