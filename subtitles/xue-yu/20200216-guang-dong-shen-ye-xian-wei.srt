# Midnight gourmet in Guangdong. Pork offal! Super Fresh! 2 hours line up for the taste of freshness.

# 简介：
# 【1月份拍摄】我是雪鱼，带你一起踏上寻味之旅。广东顺德的宵夜传奇，新鲜的猪杂放入滚烫的白粥，几分钟后就可以吃，鲜美无比。这家店晚上10点开始营业，50公里以外的屠宰场刚杀好猪，鲜活的猪杂在90分钟后被送到店里，新鲜到甚至还在跳舞，很多顾客提前2小时排队等位置，就为了这一口鲜活。一锅猪杂粥的价格在100元左右，看人数多少酌情加量减量，老板还给每桌赠送猪血韭菜汤。这家店一直营业到凌晨4点，这就是广东顺德人的深夜食堂。

# [Filmed in January] Hello, I am Xueyu, I will take you guys with me on the food-finding trip. The legendary midnight snack of Shunde, Guangdong, pork offal congee, is cooked by adding super fresh pork offal into the boiling rice congee. Only few minutes of cooking, the aroma of the congee will be maxed out. The restaurant starts the business at 10 p.m. The fresh pork offal is delivered from slaughter house to the restaurant in 90 minutes. The offal even still looks alive. Many customers come here 2 hours early only for a bite of the fresh taste of the congee. The cost of cooking a whole pot of the pork offal congee is around 100 RMB, which depends on the amount of dinners. The restaurant owner also serves every table pig blood soap with Chinese chive for free. The restaurant keeps open until 4 am. This is the midnight restaurant for people living in Shunde, Guangdong.
