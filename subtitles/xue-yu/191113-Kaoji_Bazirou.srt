#你也能看到 鸡腿是很大个的
You can also see that the chicken legs are really large

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,160
#外面是烤的皮 有点褶皱了

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,560
#而且是微黄色的 就像抹了蜂蜜一样

#咱们是透过它褶皱的外皮
Looking through its wrinkled skin, we can see

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
#看它鸡腿的本身
the meat inside

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,960
#你会发现它里面的鸡腿肉 好嫩
You will find it so tender inside

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,960
#鸡腿有个特点 拿出来的时候也能发现
You can find another characteristic of this chicken leg when you take it out

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,560
#它的汤汁 顺着皮 一直朝下流
The juice inside flows down along the skin

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,880
#凭感官 也是觉得它是柔嫩多汁的
You can feel that it is tender and juicy

71
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
#你看
Look

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,640
#它里面的鸡腿肉 就是一丝丝的
The meat inside is.. slices of 

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,880
#柔嫩的鸡腿肉
tender and soft meat

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,240
#其实 你要说鸡腿
Actually, when talk about a chicken leg (drumstick)

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,320
#可能这个是意义上的鸡腿吧
Maybe this is the "real" chicken leg

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,040
#但是它又加了这么多的肉
But (this one is) with so much additional meat

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,920
#这份鸡腿吃起来 鸡肉是更好吃的
In this chicken leg, the meat inside tastes better (than the skin)

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,520
#为什么呢 因为它的鸡肉的咸度是正好的
The reason is that the saltiness of the meat is within an appropriate range #这个表达是不是太academic了。。。

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,080
#那你说 鸡皮在外面 它会更咸
The skin is saltier since it's outside

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,440
#所以说 鸡皮不如鸡肉好吃
So the skin is not as delicious as the meat

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
#还有一点就是
Another point is

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
#它里面的鸡腿肉没有变的很柴
The meat inside is not getting dry and chewy

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
#因为里面 汤水 汤汁足够多
Because it's juicy enough inside

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
#吃起来会让你觉得鸡肉 肉嫩多汁
You can feel that the chicken is so tender and juicy

The best choice must be

We arrived here when other people just got off their work

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,480
#所以这个小房子 显得略微有些拥挤
So this small house appears to be somewhat crowded

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,520
#还是能够随便找几个座位 坐下来
But you can still find a seat, sit down

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,960
#好好吃一顿饭
And have a decent meal

63
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,280
#有没有发现 人越多
Have you found that, with more people in the restaurant

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
#你可能会吃得越香呢
You may feel that your meal is more delicious?

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,600
#大哥 这个把子肉开多久了
Bro, how long has this restaurant been running?

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,480
#10来年了
More than 10 years

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
#一直是您在做吗
Have you been running it from the beginning?

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
#一直就我在做的
Yes

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
#在这边做
Working in my restaurant here

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,840
#我看咱这边是没有厨房 直接肉
I noticed that there is no kitchen here. The meat is

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,800
#拿锅 拿桶端过来的
directly brought here with pots and buckets

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,560
#俺有厨房
I have a kitchen actually

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,600
#有厨房
I have a kitchen

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,640
#厨房不在这里
The kitchen is not here

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,760
#不在这边
Not around here

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,200
#有的把子肉在店里做 有的也不在店里做
Some of the meat is cooked in the restaurant. Some is not

77
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,280
#猪肉涨价对把子肉的生意有没有影响
Now that the pork is getting expensive. Is there an impact on "Ba zi rou" business?

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,000
#俺没有
No, not on mine

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
#也没有
No?

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,240
#俺卖的不贵 俺卖8块钱它贵吗
I don't sell it at a high price. 8 yuan/slice is not expensive at all

81
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,280
#8块钱 9块钱
8 yuan or 9 yuan

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,840
#以前也差不多吧
It's close to the previous price

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
#差不多
Not much difference

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
#涨价没 最近
Have you increased your price recently?

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
#涨了 涨了两块钱
Yes. I raised it by 2 yuan

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,480
#光要肉成9块了
You need to spend 9 yuan if you just want a slice of meat

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,240
#无所谓了 肉不挣钱 菜挣点钱也行
It doesn't matter. If I can't make money from pork, I can make money from other dishes

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,160
#是
Yep

89
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,400
#你得护着让老客户吃上 对吧
You need to care about your regular customers, right?

90
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,160
#对 对
Yes that's true

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,480
#一天 能卖多少斤猪肉
How much pork can you sell each day?

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,800
#100多斤
More than 100 Jin

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
#也可以了
That's a considerable amount

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
#每天买肉就3千多
I spend more than 3,000 yuan on buying raw meat

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,400
#4千
or 4,000

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,960
#一天4桶肉
4 buckets of meat each day

97
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,080
#一桶也有汤多汤少的时候
Sometimes there's more soup in the bucket

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,920
#原来有人说6桶肉呢
Someone calculated that we sell 6 buckets every day

99
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,200
#6桶的话 连汤带肉的
In that case, the soup is taken into consideration

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,320
#没有汤 可能6桶就剩两桶
Maybe we only sell 2 buckets without soup

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,080
#吃完还是有点撑的
I feel stuffed after this meal

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
