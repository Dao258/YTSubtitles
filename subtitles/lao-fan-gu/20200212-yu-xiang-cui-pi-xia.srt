# 【国宴大师•鱼香脆皮虾】与众不同酥皮虾，超简单低成本给面儿大菜，皮酥肉嫩有弹性，蘸着吃满口鱼香味！
# Homemade fish-flavored crispy shrimps! Crispy shell, bouncy meat, rich taste and low cost.
# 描述
# 小友们好，今天给大家带来一道与众不同的酥皮虾。
# Hello friends. Today we are bringing you guys a unique version of crispy shrimps.
# 酥皮虾大家应该很常见，
# Crispy shrimps is a relatively ordinary dish to us,
# 但今天的特别之处在于两边腹开的改刀方式，
# But today, we use a special technique that cuts through the shrimps' belly area.
# 将虾壳与虾肉完整剥离又相连，油炸后的虾壳被保留完整，
# Separate the shell from the meat, but don’t let it totally come off. Preserve the shell after fried.
# 颜色红亮又剔透，虾壳酥脆，虾肉鲜嫩。整个菜变得非常漂亮。
# The shrimps will have a bright color with a sharp clean look. Inside, the meat is fresh and tender, covered by a layer of deep-fried crispy shell. The whole dish looks extremely wonderful.
# 还有个不同之处是鱼香味的蘸碟。
# The fish-flavored dipping sauce is also unique.
# 为何要做蘸碟，而不是将调料汁撒在虾面上呢？
# Why do we choose to make a dipping sauce instead of pouring it over the shrimps?
# 欢迎小友们观看视频，多学一些小技巧！
# Welcome you to watch the video and learn some skills.

So what is it exactly?

68
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,962
# 鱼香口应该是酸甜咸鲜
A fish-flavored taste should include acidity, sweetness, saltiness, and umami.

69
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:14,297
# 微辣
A little spicy?

70
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,399
# 但是在四川什么味儿
How does it taste in Sichuan cuisine?

71
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:22,204
# 咸在前 咸甜酸辣香
Saltiness ranks the first, followed by sweetness, acidity, spiciness and aroma.

73
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:24,807

78
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,718
# 有好多网友朋友们一说
Many friends would call a recipe “authentic”

79
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:37,053
# 正宗正宗

80
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:37,853
# 什么叫正宗
What is “authentic”?

81

# 真正把川菜拿过来
If I brought you a local Sichuan dish here,

87
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:47,530
# 你其实不一定能吃
You might not be used to it.

88
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:51,267
# 我老饭骨其实也是秉承这种家庭口味

93
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,743
# 所以说别拿正宗说事

111
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:38,047
# 这油温有200度 九成油温
The temperature of oil seems to around 200 Celsius degree, 90% of the maximum temp.

112
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:39,615
# 没有九成油温
Less than 90%.

113
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,785
# 这个也就是七成 七到八成
It’s only around 70% or 80%

114
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:43,953
# 九成油温快冒烟了
Oil would have been smoking if it’s at 90%

115
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:44,253
# 看看
Look at it.

116
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:46,022
# 还是小焦
Still count on Xiao Jiao.

117
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:50,559
# 所以三叔说三七二百一么
So as San Shu said, 70% heat is 210 degrees Celsius.

118
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,229
# 这个脆皮虾关键皮得脆
The key point of this “Crispy shrimps” is its crispness.

119
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:54,797
# 再复炸一下
Let’s fry one more time.

120
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:56,932
# 网友朋友们 看看啊
Hey my friends, look at it.

121
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,835
# 这个油温高 看看虾皮是透的
The shell looks transparent as the oil temperature is high.

122
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:01,103
# 如果油温低 坏了
If the oil temperature is low, it will go bad,

123
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,004
# 乌哒哒
Looks cloudy.

124
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:04,473
# 再冲一下 更脆
Let’s fry one more time, make it crispier!

125

127
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:11,147
# 关键你看没有网友们 必须得洗干净了
Hey my friends, did you notice that? The key point is to wash the shrimps until they are absolutely clean.

128
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,281
# 看见没有 多亮
