00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:03,500
# 烙饼摊鸡蛋
Flat bread with fried eggs

5
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,533
# 咱们是半烫面半凉水
We make a dough by adding hot water first and then cold water.

6
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,400
# 咱们让这口感筋道不粘
which renders the dough more al dente and less sticky

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,866
# 倒 倒 来凉水
Go on, go on, get the cold water

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,133
# 传统做法半烫面
This is our traditional technique of making a dough

9
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,800
# 好
Cool

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,366
# 软硬合适 多细啊
- The texture is just right. - Look how carefully this is made!

11
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,366
# 鸡蛋咱们是摊鸡蛋
The eggs, we are gonna fry them

12
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:25,500
# 关键是油温合适摊这鸡蛋是两边倍儿黄
The key is to get the right oil temperature that can fry both sides golden

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,233
# 完了来点葱段酱千层烙饼
After that, stuff with some sauce and scallions in the flatbread

14
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,033
# 小烤鸭
Almost like Peking-duck-stuffed flatbread

15
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,400
# 如果全是冷水烙完不合适
It's not appropriate to use cold water to make the whole dough

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
# 烙完艮 硬
The texture of the flatbread would be hard and chewy

17
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,366
# 多刷油都不是个
And even if you add a lot of oil, you can't (soften it)

18
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:46,700
# 一半汤面一半冷水面 结合
Half warm dough and half cold dough, mixed together

19
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,133
# 三饼
Three pieces of flatbread

20
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,900
# 眼睛就是称
His eyes can weigh the dough

21
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:15,666
# 没有保密的 这饼铛必须厚点
I would not keep tip from you - the pan must be thick

22
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,333
# 因为传热散热比较合适
which is suitable for transferring and dissipating the heat

23
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,633
# 你看我也没刷油 搁在这不粘
You see I haven't used oil. It's not sticking to the board

24
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:24,433
# 看见没有特别听话
See, it's following my words

25
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:29,300
# 一头大一头小
One end be wider, and the other narrower

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
# 因为这头小点 我包上以后就和书皮一样
Cuz this end is narrower, after folding the dough will look like a book

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,733
# 它有层的 马上看啊
It's got layers, you'll see soon

28
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,066
# 咱们今天就使瓶子了啊
I'm gonna directly use the bottle

29
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:43,466
# 家里面嘛 因地制宜
It's home, so we should do according to the condition

30
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,366
# 大油是不层更好啊
Does lard make better layers?

31
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,866
# 大油口感稍为香一点
It increases the aroma a little

32
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,333
# 少许的盐不要多
A bit salt. Don't use too much

33
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,800
# 再来点薄面这点非常重要
A thin layer of flour, which is important

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,333
# 三层四层五层
Three, four, five layers

35
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,966
# 这时候得推着啊
Now you need to pull it a bit  #（看起来像是拉长了）

36
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:06,066
# 六 七叠
six, seven folds

37
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,666
# 这就为什么厨师能吹啊
This's why we say chefs are good at boasting

38
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,400
# 十六层非说千层饼
They don't say 16 but "thousands-of-layer" flatbread

39
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,000
# 稍为醒一醒啊
Let the dough rest a bit

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,266
# 小火 盖打开
Turn the fire low and open the lid

41
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,733
# 推着擀 不能死擀
Rolling the dough flat, you must push it gently instead of hitting and pushing hard

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,800
# 看见没有巧劲儿
Don't you see the hack?

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,266
# 要想手艺学的全 烙饼必须擀的圆
To learn in full all our skills, a perfectly round flatbread is a must

44
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:34,566
# 要想手艺学的全 烙饼必须擀的圆
To learn in full all our skills, a perfectly round flatbread is a must

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,966
# 推着看见没有 圆了没有
See, I'm pushing it. Isn't it round?

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,933
# 这不用放油挺奇妙的
It's so intriguing that we need no oil here

47
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,433
# 过去我们烙饼都白扑 不许有油
In the past we were not allow to use oil when cooking flatbread

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
# 也不粘
It never sticked to the pan

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,233
# 就是面粉
Just flour

50
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,266
# 小芝麻点匀了吧 没有一点油吧
The little "sesame spots" scatter evenly on the surface, don't they? There's no oil, right?

51
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,533
# 老冯 打鸡蛋
Old Feng, get me the eggs!

52
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,633
# 激动人心的一刻到了
Here's the most exciting moment

53
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,233
# 这饼是没得说了 看见没这饼
You can't say too much to praise the flatbread. Don't you see it?

54
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,433
# 饼真漂亮
The flatbread is so pretty!

55
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,000
# 看看啊这是技巧
Have a look. This manifests skills

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,566
# 你为什么要敲一下老爷子讲讲
Why are you hitting the flatbread? Could you explain a little bit?

57
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,833
# 马上层就出来了啊
The layers' coming out

58
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,500
# 敲出层
And I'm hitting them out

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,466
# 老冯炒鸡蛋吧
Old Feng, I'll let you fry the eggs

60
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,966
# 这面是真香啊
The flatbread smells so good

61
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,666

62
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,700
# 往这里打点油 来点盐
Pour some oil here, and add a bit salt

63
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,233
# 这个老头八十多了能做这么好的美食
This old man is more than 80 years old, and still able to make so brilliant a dish

64
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,200
# 这就是咱们盘道要的
That's what we are panning out here

65
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,633
# 油温稍为高一点啊
The oil temperature needs to be a little higher

66
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,133
# 完了转勺听懂了吗
And then remember the technique?

67
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:36,166
# 速度点全倒
Quickly, pour in all

68
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,633
# 看见没有别和弄
See? Don't mess it up

In fact, we usually stuff the flatbread with eggs and lots of other vegetables

74
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,266

75
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,066
# 饼加鸡蛋加葱丝加酱

77
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,833
# 吃着还不腻
It doesn't taste greasy either

78
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,566
# 给老头一个
Our old man should have one

79

00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,000
# 明天咱们吃馅儿饼呗
What about stuffed flatbread? #（翻到这里发现和烙饼的翻译重合了，但是一时没想到更好的词来翻烙饼夹鸡蛋，也不能说sandwich orz）

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
# 初四的馅儿饼
The fourth day, stuffed flatbread day

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,000
