#【国宴大师•老式宫保鸡丁】拍摄更清晰，讲解更清楚的宫保鸡丁来喽，这一次还学不会主动去罚站啦
State Banquet Masters: Traditional Kungpao Chicken. Clearer video and more detailed explanations!

#小友们好，上一次有朋友说宫保鸡丁拍摄的不够清楚，
#今天二伯给大家带来一份讲解和拍摄都更清晰的宫保鸡丁教程。
#在这里顺便统一回复一下小友们之前的提问和可能提到的问题：
#“滑过肉的油再用可以吗？”
#答：当然可以，找个笊篱上面铺一张厨房纸一过滤，清清亮亮的。
#还有小友问：“油温怎么掌控 ”
#答：一成油温三十度，如果追求精确的话可以买个测温枪。
#“为什么鸡丁第一次下油时候挂的淀粉全下来了？“
#答：油温低了
#之后我们将定期整理大家的问题，在视频或简介中对大家频繁提问的问题进行解答，
#欢迎小友们踊跃提问！
Hi everyone! Some friends complained that the last Kungpao chicken video was not shot clearly.
This time Erbai brings a clearer lesson of Kungpao chicken, with better video and more detailed explanations
Here we reply to some questions that were asked previously or could be asked:
"Can we reuse the oil that was used for 'hua you'(pre-fry)?"
Answer: Sure. Filter the oil with a piece of paper towel on a sieve. The oil will become clear again.
"How can I control the oil temperature?"
Answer: 10% heat means 30 degrees Celcius. You can buy a infrared thermometer if you want to be precise.
"Why does the starch fall off from the chicken during 'hua you'?"
Answer: The oil temperature is too low.
In the future, we will summarize your questions and answer the frequently asked ones in our videos or descriptions.
Questions are always welcomed!

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,080
#师父给讲的是原料是基础

If you want to buy this rice wine, please send Sanshu a private message. Sanshu will send you the link

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,520
#先给它抓抓黏 黏度出来
Massage the chicken first until it feels sticky

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,720

#网友你看 这汁儿 浓缩能不香吗

Only in this way can the sauce be absorbed inside

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,480
#这个汁才能稠呢 对
-In this way, the sauce will be thick and sticky. -Right

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
#不能低于十五分钟
No less than 15 minutes

50
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,920

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
#其实还可以加点水
We can add some water in fact

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,280
#加点水 嫩 水要加的要不够
Water makes the chicken tender. If we don't add enough water

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,200
#鸡丁的嫩度就不够
The chicken won't be tender enough

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,720
#这吃的是嫩
Tenderness is the selling point of chicken

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
#宫保鸡丁 脆指的是什么啊 花生
What is the "crispy" element in Kungpao chicken? Peanuts. 

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
#所以说千万不要反应过来
So never say that

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080

The chicken dices should be crispy

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,440

Is the color correct? Yes. Perfect

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,520

62
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,840
#待会咱们封个油
We will "seal" the chicken with oil later

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,760
#封那个二伯那个最牛的油
With Erbai's best oil

64
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,840
#先炸花生米 好嘞
-Fry the peanuts first. -Yay

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
#过去可以拿烤箱烤 先烤 后炸
In the past we used to roast the peanuts in the oven first. Then fry them

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
#这样可以保持几天
In this way, the peanuts remain crispy

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,000
#它永远是脆的 对
for several days. -Right

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
#好多人他不知道这事儿
Many people don't know this trick...

69
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,480
#记住了吗 直接炸了 记住了
-... and fry the peanuts directly
-Got it? -Got it.

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,000
#烤完了以后 水气都给它烤走了
After roasting, the moisture is gone

71
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,720
#倒花生米 中小火浸炸
Pour the peanuts into the wok. Soak-fry over medium-low heat

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,880
#油热了 一定要离开火
If the oil is too hot, you must remove the wok from heat

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,080
#其实油呢 有三成就够了
Actually 30% hot (~90 degrees Celcius) is enough

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,000
#你看 花生米它要求必须得脱皮
Look. The skin of peanuts must be removed in advance

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,920
#这花生米什么时候出锅合适
When should we take the peanuts out of the wok?

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,320
#听到花生米的啪啪响的时候
When you hear the "pa-pa" sound

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
#可以出锅了
The peanuts are ready

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,080
#清脆的声音 拿那个勺子 咔咔
The clear sound. Shake them in that spoon... "Ka-ka"

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,880
#清脆的声音
The crisp sound

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280
#现在就可以了 微微的见黄 可以了
Now it's done. Slightly yellow. Done!

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,600
#听见了吗 这个声音就正合适
You hear that? This is the perfect sound

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,440
#这是宫保鸡丁其中一味 叫脆
This is the "crispy" element of Kungpao chicken

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
#我们把这花椒油炸一下
Let's prepare the peppercorn oil

84
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,800
#四川花椒跟北京的花椒两种啊
Sichuan peppercorn and Peking peppercorn

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,560
#一比一 香味出来了
In a ratio of 1:1. Here comes the aroma

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,280
#为什么我要离火 你看见没有
Why am I taking the wok away from the fire? You see that?

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,920
#炸的花椒 关键点在哪呢
What's the key in frying peppercorn?

88
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
#这油温绝对不能特别热 对
-The oil mustn't be overheated. -Yes.

89
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,800
#你不能炸糊了 这是浸炸
The peppercorn shouldn't be burnt. This is soak-frying

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,720
#因为它要的是有香气味
Because this dish requires the aroma of the peppercorn

91
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,200
#这个可以了
This is OK

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,360
#调一汁儿
Let's make a sauce

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,200
#来点蒜 来点姜 葱呢 可以多搁点
Some garlic, some ginger, and some more spring onion

94
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,480
#黄酒
Rice wine (Yellow wine)

95
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,720
#像咱们老饭骨（黄）酒比较纯
We are using relatively strong rice wine here  

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
#不用太多就行
So we don't need too much

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,240
#酱油和黄酒是一比一
The ratio of soy sauce to rice wine is 1:1

98
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,320
#醋是它的一半 也不太多
Half that volume of vinegar. Not too much

99
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,840
#三分之二 对
-Two thirds. -Yep

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,920
#这糖呢 一勺
-What about sugar? -One spoon

101
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,640
#糖和醋基本上是一比一
Basically the same amount as vinegar.

102
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,680
#对 再来点就够了
Yep. A little bit more

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
#看看网友们
Take a look guys

104
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,720
#我们给你说的多细多清楚啊
We are telling you all the details

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,960
#胡椒粉呢 这个三叔知道
White pepper powder? Sanshu knows about that

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,840
#多点少点 可搁可不搁
It doesn't matter if you add more or less, or even omit it

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,480
#可多可少 搁点提香
You can add more or less. The white pepper powder enhances the aroma

108
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
#这盐呢 千万别多了
Not too much salt!

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
#那么一点足够了 再来一点吧
-That is enough. -Some more

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,160
#因为你的底味稍微的窄
Because the basic flavor is not strong enough

111
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,800
#我们还可以再提点老抽色
We can also add some dark soy sauce to darken the color

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,360
#然后 水淀粉 这个就够了
Then slurry. That's enough

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
#葱下去了
Add the spring onion

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,680
#还浅一点
The color is lighter than it should be

115
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,240
#这个颜色也浅 对
The color of the chicken is also too light

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
#再来一点  今天师爷非常慎重
Some more dark soy sauce please. The master is very cautious today

117
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
#小心的给你们做这个菜
Cooking this dish very carefully for you guys

118
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,080
#正好 这欢子真棒
That's perfect. Huanzi is awesome

119
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,760
#行 这回足够了
Cool. Enough this time

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,520
#刚才的花椒油 现在凉了以后
The peppercorn oil is cooled down now

121
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
#咱们封上油
Let's seal the chicken with the oil

122
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,360
#我先把锅给你烧热
I'm gonna heat the wok for you

123
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
#腌个十来分钟才合适呢
It'd be better to marinate the chicken for more than 10 minutes

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
#二伯的手法 技巧很高
Erbai is using a tricky technique

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,120
#待会炒这宫保鸡丁
When we cook the Kungpao chicken later

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,560
#煸锅就不用搁花椒了
We don't need to fry sichuan peppercorn first

127
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,720
#使这菜肴更加漂亮
That's making the dish look better

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,000
#味道又不失味道
While the flavor (of peppercorn) remains in the dish

129
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
#看见没有 看三叔溜锅
See that? Watch Sanshu "liu" (greasing) the wok

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,520
#咱们这锅啊 为什么有人说
The wok... Why some people asking

131
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,280
#滑油为什么扒锅呢
Why does the chicken stick to the wok during "hua you" (pre-frying)?

132
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
#因为你锅没烧到位
That's because the wok is not heated to the point

133
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,640
#咱们烧到冒烟的时候
When you see the smoke

134
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,200
#你看见没有 凉油搁进去
See that? Pour some cool oil inside

135
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,040
#看见没有咱们再转一下
Swirl the wok

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,560
#回到碗里 再回来等一下 行了
