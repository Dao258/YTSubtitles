# State Banquet Master Chef's Asian Swamp Eel fried with Prawns, a Hangzhou Sweet and Sour Dish

# 简介：
# 小友们好，是不是很久没见我们哥仨一起给大家做菜啦，有没有想我们？
# Hello friends. It's been a long time that the three of us haven't cooked together. Did you miss us?
# 今天给大家带来一道特色杭帮菜：虾仁爆鳝片！这道菜以小糖醋口儿为特点，同时虾仁和鳝片的搭配增加了菜品的营养价值：
# Today, we'll introduce a specialty Hangzhou dish: Asian swamp eel fried with prawns.
# The dish has a mild sweet and sour flavor, and also a plenty of nutrients due to the combination of eel and prawns.
# 虾仁和鳝鱼脂肪含量低，且鳝鱼含有较为丰富的蛋白质、卵磷脂，维生素，以及的特种物质“鳝鱼素”，可提高免疫力，是一道补脑健体的菜。
# Both prawns and eel are low in fat. Eel is also rich in protein, lecithin, vitamins and other materials,
# which may help your immune system, and make you stronger and smarter.
# 三叔代大家问了个好几个问题：“为什么鳝鱼都不去血，带血吃呢？为什么存放鳝鱼不能用呢？为什么要先滑虾仁后放鳝鱼呢？“
# San Shu knows what you guys will wonder:
# "Why do we cook swamp eels together with the blood?"
# "Why eels stored for a long time become uneditable?"
# "Why do we fry the prawns before the eel?"
# 嘿，咱大爷还说了，现在炒虾仁儿他都不过油，用水汆呢！这是为什么呀？
# Besides, Da Ye says he's now boiling prawns instead of frying. Why?
# 小友们要不也试一试？说不定效果也还不错？咱大爷的回答都在视频里呢！不要错过啊！
# Do you guys want to give a try? Maybe it's also good? Check this video for Da Ye's answers. Don't miss it!
# 其实咱用心做菜，菜品的色、形、味都有讲究，有的小友之前问道：为什么老饭骨做菜程序总是那么复杂呢？
# Actually, as long as we cook with heart, we need to be careful in the color, shape and flavor of the dish.
# Some friends asked: Why do Lao Fan Gu always use such a complicated process?
# 其实并不是，我们只是把我们过去多年的做菜经验通过视频传递给大家，虽然是家常菜，但每一道菜品我们都用心对待，将最美的呈现给大家。
# 希望大家能从中学到一些小诀窍，提升下厨的幸福感。当然，一通百通也是我们一直呼吁的，大家不要忘记了哦！
# Actually, no. We are just passing our years of experience via the video.
# Even for common dishes, we still cook with heart and present the best possible to you.
# Wish everyone can learn some tips and feel better in cooking.
# Of course, we've always been talking about "master the principles to master all". Don't forget it!

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,360
# 这粉子（淀粉）这是技巧
Now this is an important thing.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,240
# 少搁点粉子靠火收
‘Don’t put too much starch in it. Let the heat reduce it.’

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
# 粉子大了赶紧出 对
‘If you put too much starch, put the wok away and let it simmer.’

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,840
# 你说对了
You are right

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,280
# 小汁儿兑好 这颜色是不浅点儿啊
Here's the sauce. Is this color too light?

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,160
# 我认为稍微浅点
I think so.

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,280
# 再搁点老抽吧
Let’s put some more dark soy sauce.

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160

Now it’s good.

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,680
# 浆这个吧 很简单
Let’s marinate the prawns. Nothing fancy.

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
# 还是酒先
Still, you need rice wine first

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,520

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
# 多了 葫芦 口小肚子大
A little bit too much. The bottle has a large body.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
# 还得拿双筷子
And the chopsticks.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,320
# 说一声我给你拿
Tell me and I'll get them for you

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,440
# 别介您闪着腰怎么办
Don’t bother, I’m worried about your back.

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
# 三叔你家这个（酒）没了
San Shu, you are running out of the wine.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
# 三叔 我给你放油怎么样
San Shu, shall I pour the oil for you?

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
# 您先把火灭了吧
Just turn off the fire first.

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,160

54
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,880
# 盐 底口
Salt, the base flavor.

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,960
# 您说现在为什么虾仁进不去水
Why don't the prawns today absorb any water?

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,600
# 它本身就含水量就大 真大
They contain a lot of water in themselves already.

57
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,160
# 你看 越打越出
Exactly. The heavier you stir, the more water comes out

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,080
# 没事就拿纸蘸一下
Take some paper towel to wipe it.

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,400
# 蘸干水分 加粉子
Dry the water, add the starch.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,920
# 可以 加粉子
Yeah, continue to add the starch.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,880

62
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,840
# 按正常的搁点蛋清咱不搁了
Normally we should add some egg white as well, but we won’t do it today.

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,720
# 搁不了 再搁就澥了
Right, otherwise the prawns will be too watery.

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,720
# 咱们把鳝鱼加上盐 就是淀粉啊
Let’s put some starch in the swamp eel.

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,280
# 这鳝鱼都切好了
Wow, the eel has already been sliced.

66
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,560
# 切好了 趁您没在
Yeah, done while you were not here.

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,080
# 你知道他买回来就是斜刀片
You know he bought the slant-cut eel.

68
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,160
# 买的就是去骨的人都给切好了的
It is boneless when you bought it.

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
# 现在超市真方便
The market now is super convenient.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,800
# 二伯你愿意干活 你搅匀了
Er Bai, you must wanna work. Stir it please

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
# 我先把这个料头切了
I’ll cut these first.

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,520
# 咱这个是红椒青椒 就是配头
These are red pepper and green pepper, as the sides.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,320
# 大爷为什么鳝鱼都不去血
Why you don’t rinse the blood from the swamp eel?

74
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,560
# 都带着血吃
We always cook it with the blood.

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,120
# 鳝鱼的血是有营养的
Its blood is full of nutrients.

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,280
# 当然为什么要求我们在做鳝鱼的时候
However you definitely cannot use

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,720
# S鳝鱼不能用 存放的鳝鱼不能用
Dead eels or those have been stored for a long time.

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
# 血变质了
The blood has deteriorated.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,240
# 头天的血是鲜红的 第二天血是黑色的
First day you see the red blood, then it turns black on the next day.

80
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,280
# 所以那（第二天的）血就得把它洗了
That’s why you need to clean the blood (on the second day)

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
# 鳝鱼这血只要一变色
As long as the blood color has changed

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
# 它的鲜味就没了 而且还腥了
It will lose its umami taste and taste really bad.

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
# 而且也没有营养了
And no nutrition, neither.

84
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,040
# 因为它变质太快
Because the Asian swamp eel is too easy to get deteriorated.

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
# 所以我们鳝鱼一定是
Therefore we need to make sure that the eel

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,160
# 当天买 当天吃 当天用
Is bought, used and eaten on the same day.

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,560
# S甲鱼 S鳝鱼 S螃蟹都不能吃
Anything dead - soft-shelled turtles, swamp eels, crabs - are not edible.

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
# 咱们先把虾仁滑出来大爷
Okay let’s pan-fry the prawns first

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
# 为什么先滑虾仁
Why do we prepare the prawns first?

90
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
# 虾仁干净 给染了 这个有序
Otherwise the colors will be mixed. The order matters.

91
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,520

92
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,640
# 火大一点 就这么大
Turn the heat higher

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,800
# 油温还是差点
The oil is not hot enough.

94
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
# 虾仁水分太大 太大了
The prawns contain so much water.

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,160
# 还不敢动 你想想
Can't even move. Think about it.

96
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,080
# 咱们这青红椒在油锅里一放
Then the peppers.

98
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,000
# 这一着热就熟了
They get cooked immediately.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
# 你知道我现在炒虾仁
You know what I do with the prawns

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,040
# 在家里怎么炒么
when cooking at home?

101
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,640
# 我都不过油了 直接用水滑
I don’t even use the oil, I only use water.

102
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
# 大家感觉这虾仁
People might feel that the prawns

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,680
# 吃起来这虾仁特别的脆
taste really crispy.

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,880
# 实际上虾仁没那么脆
Actually it’s not like that.

105
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,320
# 含水量比较高
They are full of water

106
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,000
# 上浆起来效果不会太好
So, the prawns are not easy to starch well.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,640
# 所以我就直接拿水就直接汆了
That’s why I only use water to boil them.

108
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,800
# 效果还不错
It works though.

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,360
# 但是老觉得跟油滑的
But, compared to the oil method

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
# 还是相对有点区别
there's still some difference.

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
# 还是有点区别 差一点
Still a bit difference

112
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
# 油滑的香
Oil gives the aroma.

113
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
# 好了这油温可以慢慢去炸
Right now the temperature is enough for the deep frying.

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,600
# 这油温多少 五成了
- What’s the temperature now?
- About 150°C.

115
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,040
# 这鳝鱼切的条啊 他切的大长条
- The eel has been sliced already.
- They make the slices really big.

117
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,600
# 他那外边（买）进来的 他就没动
He bought directly from the market

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,360
# 我怕大爷还得（收拾）少下少下
I wanted to save some time for Da Ye

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,400
# 网友直接就买去了 还省事儿呢
Yeah people now usually do the same way. It's easier.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,840
# 就炸这种颜色 因为它有血
This how the color should be, because it has blood in it.

121
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,760
# 三叔是太聪明了
San Shu is really smart

122
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,240
# 还复油（炸）么 不用复油
- Do you need to re-fry?
- No needs.

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
# 鳝鱼嫩 你一炸就小了
The eel is so tender that it cannot be overcooked, it will shrink.

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,280
# 把它的肉炸硬了 一次成活
Deep fry the eel only once.

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,240
# 这鳝鱼不少
There is quite a lot

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,640
# 现在已经就等于是出锅了这菜
Now the dish is already finished

127
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640

128
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,240
# 留一点底油
Leave some base oil.

129
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,960
# 你看看亮子 把它倒回来了
Look, Liangzi. Now we put it back.

130
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,760
# 一烹汁 齐活
Finish it with the sauce

131
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
# 瞧这碗儿好使
See how nice this bowl is

132
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
# 开火 看见没有 烹汁儿
Turn the heat on, adding the sauce now

133
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,960

134
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,840
# 明汁亮芡 把盘拿过来
The sauce is so shiny and thick, pass me the plate please

135
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,200
# 这盘儿小点儿 小点儿就是它了
- Is this plate too small?
- It should work.

# 给点明油
And some oil

# 汁红亮芡
Check this color

139
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,800

# 大爷这是最后的一道 最经典的
And now the very last step

143

# 这是我最关键的一点
The most important thing is

144
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,200
# （白）胡椒粉 最后撒胡椒粉
White pepper. Drop the white pepper

145
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,280
# 炒的里边还有 里外两次
Remember to add the pepper twice

146
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,520
# 所以胡椒粉用的量非常大
So we'll use quite a lot of it

147
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,240
# 大爷你自己尝吧 来了

# 我就不
I don't.

149
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,480

150
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
# 快接着亮子
Come on, Liangzi

151
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,680
# 你看像不像红烧海参那样子
Look! Doesn't this look like the braised sea cucumber?

# 三叔聪明
San Shu is really smart indeed.

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,200
# 过去鳝鱼它是上浆滑油

157
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,600
# 他改成了一个炸的方法
But he changed it to the deep-fried way.

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,160
# 炸的方法呢鳝鱼更加滑嫩
This method makes the swamp eel taste more smooth

159
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,440

# 有一个保护层
It has a protection layer.

Just like with ‘clothes’

162
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,520
# 另外挂汁着味 覆味覆的好
Plus the sauce covers and stays on the eel.

163
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,800
# 再加上他拿汁拿芡拿的挺准
He controlled the heat to make the starch thicken perfectly.

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,680
# 所以你看特别亮
That’s why it looks so shiny

165
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,560
# 出锅的时候再点点香油 更显着亮
It’ll looks brighter if you add some sesame oil when you bring it to the table

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
# 胡椒粉再多点 更好吃
And more pepper

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,160
