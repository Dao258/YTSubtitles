Hello everyone! We are Lao Fan Gu, three old men from Beijing that excel at eating, cooking and chit-chatting.

Our dishes are good-looking, delicious and hardcore. All the three of us used to work as chefs of China state banquets catered to government guests. Now we are retired at home. Together with our old friends, we want to share the dishes we studied and practiced when we were young, so everyone can prepare them at home and try what country leaders are catered when they visit China.

Da Ye (Zheng Xiusheng): Executive Chef of Beijing Hotel, hosted China's 50th Anniversary dinner.
Er Bai (Sun Lixin): Planned dinner menus multiple times for China state banquets hosting foreign country leaders.
San Shu (Wu Jianli): Golden Cook of China. 3rd Generation successor of Caigoupu smoked meat. Developed 'Wu type smoky sauce'.

We will upload new videos every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
