# The next program is Steamed Chinese Cabbage in Supreme Soup (aka 'boiled chinese cabbage ')

0:00:02.820,0:00:03.670
# For the first part of making boiled chinese cabbage

0:00:03.680,0:00:04.940
# You need to hang soup

0:00:04.950,0:00:07.650
# It's soup again

0:00:07.760,0:00:10.740
# Take away this chicken claw first in the process of making soup

0:00:10.750,0:00:11.940
# we won't use it

0:00:11.940,0:00:13.180
# chicken butt neither

0:00:13.190,0:00:14.760
# I've cut off the chicken headï¼Œit has odor

0:00:14.770,0:00:16.720
# Because we are using smaller pots at home

0:00:16.730,0:00:18.200
# let's cut it into pieces

0:00:18.400,0:00:19.820
# Repeat this time

0:00:19.830,0:00:22.050
# Hanging soup is prepared for dishes

0:00:22.210,0:00:23.790
# Stewed soup is for drinking

0:00:23.800,0:00:26.470
# Bring out chicken breast

0:00:26.480,0:00:28.070
# We'll make clear soup later

0:00:28.080,0:00:29.570
# So we need this chicken breast

0:00:31.190,0:00:33.500
# It's easy to chop a chicken

0:00:33.900,0:00:36.220
# Put the chicken wings into the pot

0:00:36.230,0:00:39.330
# Take the chicken breast and cut it

0:00:39.520,0:00:40.240
# into chunks.

0:00:40.600,0:00:43.350
# smaller chunks are easier to cook

0:00:43.360,0:00:45.290
# and will save time of making soup

0:00:45.300,0:00:48.770
# The old boys are so cool

0:00:50.080,0:00:50.860
# Very good

0:00:50.860,0:00:51.630
# Very good

0:00:51.630,0:00:53.840
# Pay attention, we need to discard this part

0:00:53.860,0:00:56.420
# We call it tip in chicken

0:00:56.430,0:00:57.770
# since it is smelly

0:00:57.780,0:00:58.670
# and is unhealthy

0:00:58.680,0:00:59.360
# Yes

0:00:59.370,0:01:00.540
# Ignition

0:01:00.540,0:01:02.740
# Cold water in pot as we start

0:01:02.740,0:01:05.520
# The reason of putting chicken in soup is for freshness

0:01:05.520,0:01:07.100
# The reason of using elbows or some lean meat

0:01:07.160,0:01:08.540
# is to make it smells good .

0:01:09.720,0:01:12.260
# Bones is good for making soup

0:01:12.600,0:01:13.690
# It contains calcium

0:01:13.700,0:01:16.180
# And it also makes the soup fragrant

0:01:16.660,0:01:19.000
# Take advandage of the smell of bone

0:01:19.010,0:01:21.850
# The smell of meat and bones and the flavor of chicken

0:01:21.860,0:01:22.400
# Is it right? my brother

0:01:22.940,0:01:27.980
# Since we are making a clear soup later

0:01:27.990,0:01:29.090
# Smash the chicken breast to make 'saozi'

0:01:29.450,0:01:30.020
# Processing cabbage is simple

0:01:30.030,0:01:32.340
# But making soup is so complicated

0:01:32.350,0:01:35.530
# Boiled cabbage is a famous dish in Sichuan

0:01:36.180,0:01:37.720
# The chef who invented this dish

0:01:38.290,0:01:40.650
# is Luo Guorong from Beijing Hotel

0:01:41.040,0:01:42.070
# Sichuan cuisine master

0:01:42.690,0:01:45.130
# That day, the guest wanted to eat chinese cabbage

0:01:45.140,0:01:46.470
# want less oil

0:01:46.740,0:01:47.690
# but remains delicious

0:01:48.240,0:01:49.650
# When they served this boiled cabbage

0:01:49.660,0:01:51.170
# The guest thought it was really cabbage in boiling water

0:01:51.180,0:01:54.090
# But was shocked when he taste it

0:01:54.850,0:01:55.600
# True fragrance

0:01:56.000,0:01:57.290
# Looks like boiling water

0:01:57.290,0:01:58.850
# Cabbage is super soft

0:01:58.860,0:02:02.760
# So it became a famous Sichuan dish

0:02:02.770,0:02:04.900
# Minced Chicken ('saozi') is done

0:02:04.950,0:02:06.210
# How we are going to use this

0:02:06.220,0:02:09.190
# We use it to clean the meat soup

0:02:09.200,0:02:10.460
# Don't need to be too fine-grained

0:02:10.470,0:02:11.790
# Let it be connected

0:02:11.800,0:02:13.670
# When clean up the soup later

0:02:13.740,0:02:16.340
# It will absort all residue in the soup

0:02:16.350,0:02:19.970
# Now we put two pieces of ginger

0:02:20.030,0:02:21.250
# Two more slices of green onion later

0:02:21.420,0:02:22.040
# That's all.

0:02:22.490,0:02:23.150
# Do you see

0:02:23.160,0:02:24.410
# That is why start boiling with cold water

0:02:24.420,0:02:27.380
# This slowly extract the dirt from the inside

0:02:27.390,0:02:27.770
# now the foam comes out

0:02:27.780,0:02:29.490
# let's clean it

0:02:31.360,0:02:32.950
# all should be skimmed.

0:02:37.800,0:02:39.720
# Look at the foam

0:02:39.720,0:02:41.840
# Sometimes it's hard to skim

0:02:42.180,0:02:43.180
# just add some cold water

0:02:43.660,0:02:44.600
# To 'smash' it.

0:02:44.960,0:02:46.630
# 'Smash'

0:02:46.640,0:02:47.240
# You see

0:02:47.500,0:02:50.910
# The foam sink after I smash it

0:02:51.660,0:02:52.130
# And then continue skim the foam

0:02:53.490,0:02:56.330
# The foam is released more fully

0:02:56.330,0:02:59.330
# 'Smashing' is for skimming

0:03:00.140,0:03:02.950
# I've been on so many TV shows

0:03:02.960,0:03:04.930
# I've seen countless TV shows, too

0:03:05.500,0:03:08.400
# None of them are as hardcore as this

0:03:08.510,0:03:10.440
# Chef Zheng is selfless and patient

0:03:10.440,0:03:13.530
# Teach clearing soup twice today

0:03:14.030,0:03:17.330
# Let's move the soup to another pot

0:03:18.820,0:03:20.080
# We will insist on

0:03:20.090,0:03:21.480
# What I said last time

0:03:21.490,0:03:24.140

0:03:25.530,0:03:26.460
# Put it here

0:03:30.890,0:03:32.100
# The bone needs more time

0:03:32.200,0:03:33.150
# My pot is a little bit small

0:03:33.150,0:03:34.910
# Need to boil each side

0:03:35.210,0:03:37.120
# Home edition also need carefulness

0:03:37.130,0:03:40.390
# The process is the same as that in hotel

0:03:40.510,0:03:41.350
# Sometimes it is necessary

0:03:41.360,0:03:42.550
# to wash it

0:04:02.890,0:04:05.200
# Need four hours for ordinary pot

0:04:05.200,0:04:07.440
# Using pressure cooker takes basically 25 minutes to half an hour

0:04:07.450,0:04:07.960
# Is that so?

0:04:07.970,0:04:10.140
# It takes more than an hour including deflating

0:08:53.880,0:08:55.590
# What means 'smashing'?

0:08:55.600,0:08:58.080
# Let me show you today

0:08:58.090,0:08:58.540
# good

0:08:58.550,0:08:59.310
# Get some cold water

0:08:59.320,0:09:02.600
# The soup has few foam on its surface

0:09:02.610,0:09:04.600
# Maybe there are still some foam inside, so 'smash' it

0:09:04.610,0:09:05.350
# Do you see

0:09:05.670,0:09:08.270
# 'smash' using cold water

0:09:08.280,0:09:08.890
# The set the fire high.

0:09:08.900,0:09:10.580
# See

0:09:10.590,0:09:10.780
# Yes

0:09:10.790,0:09:13.090
# It is crystal clear now

0:09:13.100,0:09:13.950
# We can even see bottom of the pot

0:09:13.960,0:09:15.930
# And the chicken breast sinks

0:09:16.340,0:09:17.090
# You see

0:09:17.630,0:09:19.290
# It's going down slowly

0:09:19.630,0:09:21.160
# There will be some foam taken out by the mincered chicken later

0:09:21.950,0:09:22.260
# Smash

0:09:22.270,0:09:26.180
# It's just to bring out all the foam, even in the mincered chicken

0:09:26.190,0:09:27.620
# Come on, come on

0:09:38.660,0:09:40.910
# You see, it is clearer

0:09:43.560,0:09:43.810
# Okay

0:09:43.820,0:09:46.760
# Turn off the fire.

0:09:46.770,0:09:47.440
# Turn off the fire

0:09:47.450,0:09:49.720
# Turn off the fire and filter now

0:09:51.180,0:09:54.270
# we'd better hanging or stewing for half an hour

0:09:55.850,0:09:56.880
# Next time we talk about stewing

0:09:56.890,0:09:59.200
# When we done stewing, everything sink to the bottom

0:09:59.210,0:10:03.270
# In addition, the flavor of mincered chicken can be triggered by hanging

0:10:04.520,0:10:06.640
# You see, the flavour of chicken comes out

0:10:06.650,0:10:07.170
# Yes

0:10:07.350,0:10:09.570
# Look at the soup. The chicken is smashed down

0:10:09.900,0:10:11.860
# The color is yellow

0:10:11.860,0:10:14.860
# Pay attention to mincered chickenwhen filtering

0:10:14.870,0:10:16.010
# There are dregs in it

0:10:16.020,0:10:17.420
# Do not stir.

0:10:17.430,0:10:20.780
# Finally, we'd better use double layer Doubao cloth

0:10:20.930,0:10:23.070
# Double layer Doubao cloth

0:10:23.310,0:10:26.860
# After that, use paper to dip oil

0:10:26.870,0:10:28.690
# In the past, this is the most fastidious detail in banquet

0:10:28.690,0:10:30.140
# The soup is ready

0:10:30.150,0:10:31.260
# Now it's time to season

0:10:31.270,0:10:32.060
# Salt.

0:10:32.470,0:10:33.850
# White pepper powder

0:10:34.160,0:10:37.930
# Because this soup is made of baby cabbage

0:10:38.180,0:10:39.890
# it might be a little bitter

0:10:39.900,0:10:41.010
# When we season soup

0:10:41.020,0:10:43.730
# Put a little sugar

0:10:44.780,0:10:45.140
# good

0:10:45.150,0:10:46.290
# Now we are done

0:10:46.300,0:10:48.580
# This time pour it on the cabbage

0:10:56.540,0:10:58.720
# When should we stop steaming?

0:10:58.730,0:11:02.550
# When the cabbage floats

0:11:02.610,0:11:05.830
# When it floats

0:11:06.140,0:11:10.320
# Boiled Chinese Cabbage in Soup!

0:11:10.330,0:11:12.060
# I made some innovation

0:11:12.120,0:11:13.480
# I put some medlar

0:11:15.290,0:11:15.680
# Uh huh.
