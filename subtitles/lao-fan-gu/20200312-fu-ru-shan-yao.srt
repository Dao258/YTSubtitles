# 【国宴大师•腐乳山药】超简单创意小甜品：用天然色素染个小红“酱豆腐”和山楂小红果，诶嘿，真美！ |老饭骨
# Easy innovative dessert: Use natural food coloring to make red "fermented bean curd" and "hawthorns", amazing!

# 簡介
# 晚上好呀！之前总有小友呼吁做做甜品，今天我们隋师傅就做一道创意菜，给大家伙带点儿乐。嘿，用山药来做一个山寨的酱豆腐乳和山楂小红果儿。这道甜品操作简单，成品极美，大家伙儿可以学一学！
# Good evening, we have been suggested to make deserts. Today, Master Sui will teach us an innovative dessert that uses Chinese Yam to imitate fermented bean curds and hawthorns.
# 这酱豆腐也叫酱豆腐乳，是一种经过微生物发酵的豆制品，通常口味鲜、咸、辣。
# Fermented bean curd is usually salty and spicy.
# 而我们今天用山药做的山寨版酱豆腐则是一道小甜品，山药本身带着点甜度，甜而不腻，刚刚好。
# However, the dish we are making today is a sweet dessert. Since Chinese yams already have sweetness, this dessert won't be too sweet and is delicious.
# 知道究竟怎么把白如羊脂的山药做成红通通、亮晶晶的腐乳和山楂小果吗？您请继续看下去喽
# If you want to know to turn white Chinese yams into red, shiny bean curds and hawthorns, the video will tell you all the secrets.
# 猜到了吗，这天然色素来自红菜头熬成的汁儿，这红菜头切开变色，得熬至少30分钟，等它那个红红的颜色出来了就行了。
# Guess what, the food coloring comes from beetroot juice. We have to boil the beetroots for at least 30 min.
# 而山药则一定要选择铁棍山药，因为其淀粉含量高，加热有黏度，才能做出酱豆腐的口感。
# As for Chinese yams, we have to use iron stick yams, since they contain high level of starch. Therefore, we will be able to imitate the texture of fermented bean curds.
# 大家要是学会了就赶紧自己在家捣腾捣腾吧，这小腐乳和小红果儿，红红火火，亮晶晶，多漂亮呀！
# If you learn something from this video, try it at home! This "bean curds" and "hawthorns" are simply beautiful and gorgeous.

Roll it, beautiful!

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,280
# 山楂小红果
They are like hawthorns,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,840
# 小红酱豆腐
or red fermented bean curds.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,240
# 亮晶晶 漂亮
So shiny and beautiful.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,360
# 红菜头
Beetroots,

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,760
# 铁棍山药
Chinese Yam.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,600
# 这是红菜头切之前的样子
This is what beetroot looks like before you cut it.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,080
# 我们以为什么呢 咸菜疙瘩
We thought it was a lump of pickled vegetable or somthing.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,160
# 这一切开马上就变了色了
But, as soon as you cut it open, it changes color.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,080
# 不一样了 看看
Looks, it's different.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,400
# 天然色素
This is natural food coloring.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
# 把脏的皮只要洗干净可以了
We have to clean the dirty skins.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,040
# 煮上就行
And then, boil the beetroots.

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,120
# 煮多长时间
For how long?

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,280
# 今天您看 就已经煮了三十分钟了
Today we have already boiled for 30min.

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,720
# 煮这个你主要是看这颜色行就行
It mainly depends on its color.

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,840
# 一定是选铁棍山药 是面的
We have to choose iron stick yam, because it is very mushy inside.

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,600
# 含淀粉量高一点
Because it contains high level of starch,

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,760
# 就需要要它里边的绵
it is very mushy and smooth inside.

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,040
# 就含淀粉量比较高
Has lots of starch.

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,120
# 淀粉加热就变成有黏度的 没错
Yes, and after you heat it up, the starch becomes sticky.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,600
# 这我削完皮以后就蒸
I will steam them after peeling off the skins.

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
# 这就是咱们蒸好的
Those have already been steamed.

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,640
# 提前蒸好的 二十分钟
We steam them for about 20min.

25
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,240
# 二十分钟 蒸透蒸黏
Yea, 20min will thoroughly cook them.

26
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,600
# 菜墩有一个红点 那是染的
Our cutting board has a little red dot on it. This came from the beetroot.

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,640
# 所以说网友朋友们
So,

28
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,600
# 咱们切红菜头
If you want to cut beetroot,

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,440
# 尽量底下垫一个毛巾垫一个布
we recommend putting a towel between it and the cutting board.

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,040
# 省的把菜墩子染了
So that the beetroot won't dye our cutting board.

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
# 它是天然色素
It is natural food coloring.

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,280
# 我慢慢干着 有樱桃
I'm not in a rush. Here are the cherries.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,920
# 把把儿给我留着 把儿别给我扔了
Don't throw away the handles on the cherries please.

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,160
# 一定要趁热
We have to mash the yams while they are still hot.

35
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,760
# 凉了之后淀粉它就自动凝固了
Because the starch will solidify after it cools down.

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,200
# 凝固了它就不能用
Then, we cannot use it anymore.

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,360
# 这是一甜口菜
We are making a dessert

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,520
# 铁棍山药本身它就含糖
Since Chinese yam contains sugar itself,

39
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,200
# 吃的是有微甜的感觉
it actually tastes a little sweet.

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,080
# 不用再加糖
So, we don't have to add any extra sugar.

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
# 愿意吃甜口更重一点的
But if you like sweet food,

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
# 加点糖没问题
you certainly can add more sugar at your own preference.

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,920
# 蜂蜜也可以 但是适量
Honey works as well, but we cannot add too much.

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,200
# 一定不能影响它的凝结
Otherwise it will solidify the yams.

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,760
# 其实还是那句话 一通百通
In general, if you can master one thing, you can as well master other things.

46
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
# 你可以做臭豆腐吗
Can you make Chinese Stinky Tofu from this yam?

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,480
# 我给你熬一灰色的
I will make you a gray-color sauce.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,960
# 您看刚才您吃完那把儿
You see the little handle from the cherry.

49
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
# 我得先给它整一下型
I will make a shape first.

50
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,040
# 使手捏一下
Sqeeze with my fingers.

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,120
# 隋师傅做活就是干净
Master Sui is so clean.

52
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,000
# 永远戴手套
Always wearing gloves.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
# 弄个眼
We poke a little hole on it.

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,680
# 好看
Nice!

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,600
# 然后就跟它一比这不就爷俩了吗
Compare to a cherry, it is like grandfather and grandson.

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
# 一会儿挂完颜色再看看
We will see later after coloring it.

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,240
# 下边铺一张锡纸或者保鲜膜
We can pave a layer of plastic or aluminum foil on the bottom.

58
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,320
# 取的时候好取 方便
So that it is easier to take the yams off.

59
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,400
# 靠到一边
Set this aside.

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,720
# 然后用手给它加工到
And then use our hands

61
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,200
# 和腐乳厚度相似 差不多
to shape it into the thinkness of a fermented bean curd chunk.

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,800
# 如果没有这个 您家里边有什么
If you don't have this kind of metal box,

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,520
# 这种带楞带角的方形的
you can use any square shaped containers.

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
# 比如饭盒 一次性餐盒都可以
Like lunch box, or throw-away lunchbox.

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
# 给它拍平了之后
After we make this flat,

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,160
# 要放冰箱给它（冷藏）一下
we need to freeze it

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,840
# 进冰箱怎么着最短也得十五分钟
for at least 15min.

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,440
# 冷却透 让它淀粉凝固了就可以了
We have to completely solidify the starch inside the yams.

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
# 不耽误大家时间
We won't waste your time.

70
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,320
# 我提前冻好了一块
I have already frozen one.

71
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
# 真有心眼子
So smart!

72
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,840
# 跟大白油似的 多好看
Like white fat, beautiful.

73
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,680
# 这山药 白如羊脂
This yam is as white as mutton fat.

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,680
# 根据大约腐乳的大小
We will make it the size of a fermented bean curd chunk.

75
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
# 三叔咱们就做六块吧
San Shu, let's make six pieces.

76
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,960
# 我觉得够咱俩吃一块就行了
I feel like one piece is enough for us.

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,280
# 我闻闻味 这味还小
Let me smell it. There aren't too much smell on it.

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,520
# 这六块够了
Six pieces are enough.

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,920
# 然后咱们把汁要给它过滤出来
Then, we have to strain out the beetroot sauce.

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,160
# 熬的差不多了 够黏够稠 颜色够重
This is good, both the stickiness and the color.

81
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
# 过下箩
Over the strainer.

82
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,080
# 糖一勺就行 微微小甜
We will add only a spoon of sugar for a slight sweetness.

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,360
# 鱼胶粉也搁一小勺 差不多
And a spoon of gelatin.

84
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,840
# 再来一点也行
Maybe a little more.

85
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,200
# 这把它搅匀之后
After mixing it thoroughly,

86
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,160
# 得让它冷却到四十度左右
we have to cool it down to around 40 degree Celcius.

87
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,920
# 它已经粘稠了再往上挂
We have to wait until the sauce is sticky enough.

88
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,200
# 热着挂不上
Otherwise it won't sticky to the yam.

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,360
# 得 这汁冷却得了
It should be good right now.

90
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,520
# 然后咱们测一下基本温度
Let's measure the temperature.

91
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,000
# 高科技仪器 二十九点一 可以

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,280
# 咱们看基本的状态
Let's feel it.

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,440
