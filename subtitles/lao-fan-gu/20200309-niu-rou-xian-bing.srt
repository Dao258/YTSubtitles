# 简介
# 小友们好，这顿初四的牛肉馅饼，咱们的国宝级面点大师可是准备了一早上。
# Hi my friends! It's the fourth day of the lunar new year. Our master chef has been preparing this Beef Pie for the whole morning.
# 都说牛肉馅饼要想做得好，成不成全在这打馅儿上了。
# As the saying goes, it's the filling that makes a beef pie.
# 牛肉最好是2分肥，8分瘦，肥瘦相间吃起来才更鲜嫩多汁。
# Mixture of 20% fat and 80% lean will give you a juicy and tender mouthfeel.
# 面饼要擀得比饺子皮稍微薄一点，烙的时候记得刷几层菜籽油。
# Rolling out the dough thinner than dumpling wrappers, and brush a few layers of canola oil while cooking.
# 这样做出来的牛肉馅饼焦黄里嫩，馅大皮薄，一刀切下去都在流汁儿呢！
# Follow our recipe to make this crispy, golden and tender beef pie with a thin shell and lots of filing. See how juicy it is when we cut it!
# 老爷子为了传承记忆中的味道，都是毫无保留地教给大家他的秘方。
# Our old pal unreservedly shares his secret recipe to pass on the taste in memory.

55
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:52,933
