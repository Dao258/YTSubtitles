# 麻豆腐
Madoufu (mung bean solids, by-product of cellophane noodle production)

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
# 有很多人来北京说吃不惯麻豆腐
Many who come to Beijing don't like Ma Tofu at first

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,560
# 咱们就做羊油的
We'll make one with tallow (mutton fat)

9

# 人家吃不习惯怎么办
What if they don't like it?

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,880
# 吃不习惯 素油炒这种技法也可以
Then we can use vegetable oil instead

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,360
# 毛豆仁儿提前入一下味儿
We give some seasoning to the shelled edamame beans

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,760
# 大料 花椒粒 盐 别的不用加

# 咱就先把雪里蕻焯一下水 因为它咸
We first rinse the Xuelihong in boiling water to remove some salt

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,720
# 麻豆腐雪里蕻跟豆儿是绝配 离不开
Ma tofu and potherb mustard are the perfect match. Inseparable.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,520
# 雪里蕻不能太少了
Don't put too little potherb mustard

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
# 咱就干焙 不放油
Let's dry fry it without oil

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,040
# 其实雪里蕻是麻豆的筋骨
Potherb mustard is the backbone of Ma Tofu

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,480
# 专业术语叫魂儿 筋骨
Technically speaking, the soul of Ma Tofu

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,520
# 煮好的豆 最好是泡个一个小时
It is the best to soak the cooked edamame in the cooking liquid for an hour

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,080
# 大料 花椒那个味儿入进去
To ensure the flavor of star anise and Sichuan peppercorns permeates through the beans

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,040
# 五香豆儿说白了就是
They are basically five-spice beans

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,960

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,560

Just dry it for a bit.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,080
# 咱们现在开始耗油
We now start to infuse the oil

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,760
# 关键是在耗油
This is the crucial part

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,280
# 这个药料咱也先给它洗一下
Wash these spices

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,040
# 再搁点葱出点葱香味
Give some fresh spring onions, for the flavor

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
# 把所有的料下下去
Now put all the spices into the wok

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,320
# 麻豆腐关键的是油 香香的
It's all about the oil, aromatic!

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
# 耗油的同时咱把口儿给它调出来
In the meantime we should start on the tofu

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,920
# 把雪里蕻加进去 豆儿
shove in the potherb mustard and beans

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
# 麻豆腐是什么做的

# 绿豆 先得泡 泡完以后打碎了
Mung means. Soak, and then grind them

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,600

Let it sit until it gets slimy

00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,040
# 它那个汁儿提出来
The liquid can be separated and then fermented

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,440
# 发酵完了就是豆汁
and it becomes Douzhi
(fermented mung bean milk, another traditional Beijing dish)

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,880
# 渣子就是麻豆腐
The remaining solids are the Madoufu

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,960
# 这个东西离不开黄酱 澥好的黄酱
Diluted yellow soybean sauce is a must for this dish

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
# 香啊是吧 层次感很强
Aromatic right? Strong, multi-dimensional scent

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,080
# 稍微提一点糖 糖提鲜 来一点
Give it a little sugar for more umami

51

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,800
# 还有秘诀 咱把炸好的葱捞出来
Secret of my recipe: take out all fried scallion

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,400
# 再切点葱末 没少用葱啊
Chop more spring onions. We are using a lot of it today.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
# 突出葱香味儿
To highlight the scallion flavor

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
# 看见没有网友 把炸好的葱切成末
Pay attention my friends, chop the fried scallion into fine dices

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,400
# 然后拌在里头吃着香
and mix it with the dish

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,880
# 下一个节目 豆汁
for our next trick, DouZhi!

58
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,960
# 用豆汁澥麻豆腐 原汁原味
We used Douzhi to dilute the Madoufu. Stay true to their shared origin.

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,000

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,600
# 香 酸香
Aromatic, It smells sour but aromatic (the smell of Douzhi)

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
# 咱们起锅坐油 关键是油
Now we setup a wok and pour in the oil, the crucial part

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
# 油可以多一点没关系 不要怕油大
We can use a little more oil. Don't be afraid of using too much

63
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
# 既然做咱们就往传统上做
We are following the traditional way today. 

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,440
# 想吃油少油多的自己去调整
You can use whatever amount of oil as you like 

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,960
# 再一次的大量的葱花 葱香味
Again, lots of scallion. The aroma of scallion.

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
# 差不都了这菜
We are almost there

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,160
# 二十年专注京味菜
I've focused on Beijing cuisine for twenty years

68
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,000
# 讲究 香 离不开这香味
The smell of a dish is heavily emphasized. The aroma.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
# 有回味啊 改小火
There will be an aftertaste. Turn down the gas

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,880
# 把麻豆腐下进去
Shove in the Madoufu

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,840
# 跟炸酱面似的 待会弄碗面条得了
Looks just like Zhajiangmian noodles' gravy. Maybe we make some noodles later

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,760
# 小火去推 必须得推
Push it over a low flame

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,200
# 待会您看 这时候有油
You can see some oil floating at the moment

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
# 待会就没油了 全推进去了
and it will all be pushed into the tofu a while later

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
# 小火慢慢熬 就跟炸酱似的
Use a low flame, just as you are making Zhajiangmian noodles' gravy

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,880
# 熬多长时间师父 一般
How long do we decoct it, master?

77
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,200
# 最少得二十分钟
20 minutes at least

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,960
# 要如果有时间的话 四十分钟小火

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
# 多香 糗透了

81
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,320
# 麻豆腐 酱 雪里蕻的香气

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,960
# 融合到一起 多棒
All mixed together beautifully! Awesome!

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,440
# 您看没油了是吧三叔
See how there is no more oil seen now, Sanshu?

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,360
# 咱们现在基本上推了二十分钟了
We've been stirring it for 20 minutes now

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,720
# 待会往外噗噗冒气 气顶勺
There will me more steam over time

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,560
# 像我这样推四十分钟（更香了）
I've stirred it for 40 minutes (gets even better)

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,600
# 来欢子推会儿 徒弟推
Come, Huanzi. Take my position for a while
Apprentice do the job

# 我推这还真是有经验
I am actually really experienced in this

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
# 从小一来北京学徒就开始推这个
I have been doing this (pushing Madoufu) since I was an apprentice when I first came to Beijing

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,120
# 为什么他长得帅呢
Why is he good-looking?

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,440
# 就因为推麻豆腐推的
Because he has pushed a lot of Madoufu

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,120
# 还手工灌肠 外边都是自己买
Also making homemade sausages. Other restaurants buy them from vendors

93
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
# 我们都是自己做
But we make our own sausages in-house

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,640
# 这麻豆腐不搁羊油不搁酱
If you don't make Ma Tofu with mutton fat and soybean paste

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,080
# 出不来香味
There will not be enough aroma

96
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,120
# 一般咱们家使的都是豆油是吧
Normally, people use soybean oil at home?

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
# 各种花生油 豆油都可以
Peanut oil or soybean oil is ok, too

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,840
# 就是素油 都可以
Or vegetable oil. All good.

99
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
# 素油也是这种方式
It's the same way if you choose to use vegetable oil

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,360
# 还是那句话
Once again,

101
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
# 你喜欢吃哪口儿
whatever taste you like

102
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,000
# 你用哪口儿油 都可以
you can use whatever oil you want. All would work

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,480
# 关键是制料油跟葱油的时候
The key is when you make the spice-infused oil and scallion-oil

104
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,760
# 得制好了 一通百通
You have to make that right. And once you know the principle you can apply it to other dishes.

105
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,560
# 这个基本形状可以了
This shape looks good enough

106
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,440
# 出丝了 出丝了啊
There are filaments

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,600
# 差不多得了 翻下勺
That's ok, you don't have to do it anymore

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,400
# 一看立住了
Look, it stands by itself

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
# 咱刨一个坑儿
We make a well on top

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,760
# 你知道这刨坑儿还不能说
Don't talk about the well!

111
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
# 待会他们就全看见了
They will see it later

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
# 韭菜越搁越多越香 韭菜不能少了
The more Chinese chives you put in the more aromatic it gets

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,280
# 辣椒油呢 辣椒油待会现呲
Where's the chilli oil? We will make the chilli oil.

114
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,440
# 欢子看你的手艺了今天
It's all on you Huanzi

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,480
# 师父考考你
Pop quiz for you:

116
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,600
# 这是什么油 色拉油
What's this oil? Vegetable oil

117
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,360
# 还是把辣椒洗一下
Let's wash the chilli first

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
# 洗一下油温高点没事
This way it won't burn so easily when you pour hot oil over it

119
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
# 没问题
No Problem

120
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,120
# 关键是这呲啦一下
Carefull, It's neck or nothing

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400
