# State Banquet Master Chefs' Balsamic Vinegar Beltfish Roll. Crispy, boneless, juicy and tasty
# 简介：
# 小友们好，最近是不是很久没看到我们老饭骨哥仨一起出现了？大家想我们吗？
# 今天是由三叔的徒弟小东北给大家带来一道中西融合菜——黑醋带鱼卷。
# 我们用的是意大利黑醋，家里没有黑醋的小友们用自己本地的醋就可以了。
# 带鱼呢，它本身也是一味中药材，具有补虚，解毒，止血之功效。
# 吃带鱼对我们的身体大有好处，但是带鱼就怕处理不好腥味重。
# 带鱼要先进行腌制去除腥味，然后放进油锅里炸至金黄脆嫩。
# 最后还要淋上熬制许久的黑醋，酸甜可口！
# 这道菜得到了我们的一致好评，不仅味道好，在成菜形式上也接轨国际，
# 真正做到了融会贯通。看这摆盘，多美！
# 各位小友们在观看视频的时候也要活学活用，一起把这些好的技法传承下去！

# Hi folks. Don't you think it’s been a long time since the last time you guys saw all three of us in front of the camera?  Do you miss us? Today, we invite Xiao Dongbei, San Shu’s student, to present a fusion dish -- Balsamic Vinegar Beltfish Roll.
# The vinegar we use here is balsamic vinegar. If you don’t have it in your home, you can cook with local brands of vinegars.
# As for the beltfish, it’s considered a Chinese medicine that may help with restoration, detoxification, and hemostasis.
# Beltfish is good for our health. But you have to cook it properly, otherwise the fishy smell will ruin it.
# Firstly, beltfish needs to be marinated to remove the unwanted smell. Then deep-fry it in the wok until it turns golden brown and crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.
# At last, we pour balsamic vinegar glaze over it. Sweet and tangy, the dish tastes delicious and uses a western inspired plating.
# By this way it truly achieves mastery of cooking. Check out the presentation, beautiful!
# I hope you guys could apply these techniques you learnt from the video flexibly and pass them on.

# 它算无鳞鱼的一部分

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,440
# 其实它外边这种白膜 就算它的鳞

# 有的进口带鱼又肥又大

# 但是它脊背上有两个疙瘩 石骨
But there are two knots on its spine, which are called Shi Gu (rock bone).

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
# 你看这是石骨
Check out the knots.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,440
# 一般正宗舟山带鱼里边是没有石骨的
Normally, authentic beltfish from Zhoushan do not have Shi Gu.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,880
# 你看一眼这石骨
Have a look on it.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,480

# 但是它有一个不好的地方 有点腥

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,320
# 尤其在石骨那位置 特别腥
Especially at its Shi Gu area, extremely fishy.

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,920
# 葱姜水 倒点黄酒
Scallion and ginger juices, a little bit rice wine.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,560
# 葱姜水放好了 来点底味 来点盐
After that, add on some base taste, a little bit salt.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
# 黄酒有了 盐
Rice wine is good, so as salt.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,080
# 要腌制 很简单
It’s simple to marinate.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
# 这个鱼葱姜水 黄酒腌完之后
After beltfish is marinated with ginger juice, scallion juice, and rice wine,

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,200
# 然后咱们用厨房用纸
We use kitchen towel

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,240
# 把它的水分蘸干
to dry the fish

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,880
# 然后再卷

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,840
# 刚才闻这鱼还真有点腥
The beltfish was fishy a moment ago

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,400
# 通过他腌制以后这腥味你看 没了
Now the odor is removed by the marination.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
# 你闻闻 一点都没了
Smell it, its odorless now.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,840
# 就剩盆味了 他处理的很好
Only the smell of the pot remains. He did a really good job.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
# 开始卷了师父
Now I start to roll the fish, master.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,840
# 这一条卷几个
How many rolls can a fish filet make?

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
# 一条相当于四卷吧
Four.

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,800
# 这么大就行了
This is the right size.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,720
# 咱们家里边根据个人的喜好
You can adjust the size as you like.

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,120

44
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,960
# 一条卷四卷 这卷真不小
Four roll per fish. The size is massive.

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
# 半条鱼下去了
Half of the fish is used.

46
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,520
# 知道大爷能吃
I know Da Ye has a good appetite.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,160
# 用牙签咱们给它固定上 这方法好
Secure the roll with a toothpick. This is a smart method.

48
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,480
# 然后等一下就插好就风干
After this, get the fish air dried.

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,600
# 风干多长时间 风干一小时吧
How long does it take? Around a hour.

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,080
# 你看见没还得修一下
You should trim the edges as well.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,000
# 讲究 还跟花似的 你看多美
Exquisite! Like gardening flowers. Look how beautiful it is!

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,920
# 你看如果说我们家里要是自己做
If you cook at home,

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,960
# 就不用这样了 没必要
It’s not necessary to do this step.

54
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,680
# 我要喜欢吃这些怕浪费
In this way, you won't waste any of the fish.

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,720
# 直接改成段 也一样吃是吧
You don't even have to roll it up. Just cut it into chunks and it would taste the same

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,520
# 我拿去风干 然后咱们熬个醋
I’ll take it to air-drying. Now we prepare the balsamic glaze.

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,160
# 就放自己家窗边风干个一小时就行
You can put it near the window for air-drying. For an hour.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
# 熬醋的时间就可以了
It will be good after we finish cooking balsamic glaze.

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,320
# 然后拿电扇吹行不行 那最好了
Can you use a fan for air-drying? That will be the best.

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,640
# 最好家里熬醋用铝锅是最好的
It is best to use an aluminium wok to prepare the vinegar sauce.

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,920
# 铁锅跟醋熬出来之后
If you use an iron wok,

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,800
# 它有股铁生锈的味道
The sauce would have a metallic taste.

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,880
# 什么醋 这是意大利黑醋
What vinegar it is? It’s balsamic vinegar.

64
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,080
# 但是咱们在家做根据个人的喜好
But as always, you can choose any vinegar you like.

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,320
# 比如你是山西人
For instance, if you are from Shanxi,

66
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,920
# 可以用陈醋 用香醋
You can use aged dark vinegar, or Zhenjiang vinegar.

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,080

68
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,000
# 你是哪的人用哪的醋
You can always choose your local vinegars.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,320
# 其实黑醋它一般的酸味不容易走
The acid of balsamic vinegar doesn't evaporate as easily

70
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,480
# 这是冰片糖 两块
This is golden slab sugar. Two pieces.

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,320
# 过去粤菜常用的 很容易买到
It was widely used in Guangdong cuisine. You can get it in most grocery stores.

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,600
# 冰糖 半瓶醋的话
Chinese rock sugar, half bottle of vinegar.

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,520
# 也就是二百五十克
It’s around 250g.

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,040
# 熬醋的时候必须放点姜
Ginger is a must for this vinegar glaze

75
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,920
# 为啥 它有一股果香的味道
Why? Because it has a fruity taste.

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,920
# 意大利醋它的酸味是稳定的
The taste of balsamic vinegar is stable.

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,360
# 因为它是果蔬酿造出来的
Because it is made from fruit.

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
# 就是它不易挥发
In other words, it’s less-volatile.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
# 镇江香醋就完全可以
Zhenjiang vinegar is a good alternative as well.

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
# 米醋就差点 颜色不行
Rice vinegar won't work as well. The color is not strong enough.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
# 米醋熏醋都差点
Neither does smoked vinegar.

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,720
# 家里边就冰糖 冰糖就可以
For home cooking, rock sugar is fine.

83
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,480
# 放点姜 没那么多要求
Put in some ginger. It’s not that strict.

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,640
# 酒店他对出品要求严格一点
The hotel will have a higher standard of the food quality.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,640
# 熬多长时间 熬二十分钟吧
How long for reducing? Around 20 minutes.

86
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,040
# 熬化了它 然后让醋有粘稠度
Until the rock sugar dissolves, which will thickens the glaze.

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,960
# 咱们家里燃气灶这是最大的火了
This is the highest heat we can get at home.

88
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
# 大火烧就行
It’s good.

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,480
# 带鱼炸么 炸
Do we fry the beltfish? Yes.

90
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,720
# 必须的 不炸还行
We have to deep fry the fish.

91
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,880
# 这熬醋的时间咱就可以炸带鱼了
Let's fry the fish while the vinegar reduces.

92
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,280
# 熬黑醋的时候火不用降
Keep the heat

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
# 一直大火就行了
At the high level all the time.

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,280
# 收到自己的想要的粘稠度就ok了
Reduce it until you are happy with the consistency

95
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,480
# 带鱼刚才咱们风干了一个小时
Now the beltfish has been air dried for an hour.

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,400
# 就成这种颜色
The color turns into this.

97
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,600
# 然后外皮干了
And skin is dry.

98
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,520
# 干的炸出来颜色更好看  更金黄色
The color will look better when the surface is dry. More golden brown.

99
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,160
# 你看慢慢拉黏了 开始粘稠了
Check out the glaze. It’s getting thick now.

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,960
# 这颜色挺漂亮的
The color looks wonderful.

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,320
# 发亮了 发红发亮了
It’s getting brighter. And it turns red.

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,720
# 二伯您看黑醋跟姜的结合
Er Bai, check the combination of the balsamic vinegar and ginger.

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,520
# 出来一种可乐的味道 果香的味道
They smell like coke, very fruity.

104
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,640
# 让人一闻
An adorable smell.

105
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,440

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
# 二伯陶醉了
Er Bai is indulging in it.

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,680
# 可以了 油温六成 开始炸了
It’s ready. 60% heat (180°C). Now we start to fry.

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,800
# 炸完这鱼的油 能用么还
Is the oil reusable after frying the fish?

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
# 能用啊 然后我们加点葱姜 再熬一个
Absolutely. Fry some scallion and ginger in it.

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,080
# 这不就成葱油了么 没错
Then it becomes scallion-ginger oil, no? Exactly.

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,960
# 所以二伯说了
As Er Bai said,

112
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,040
# 剩下的油可以熬葱油 可以炒菜
the rest of the oil can be used for making scallion oil. It can be used for stir-frying.

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,200
# 炸带鱼这东西
When frying the beltfish,

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,560
# 搁进锅里就不要动它 不要理它
Don’t move it around too much. Leave it alone.

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,640
# 它什么时候壳挺了以后再动
You can move it until the skin sets and turns crispy.

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,040
# 否则的话它容易碎
Otherwise the meat would crumble.

117
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,880
# 看见没有开始粘稠了
Check out, it’s getting thick.

118
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,160

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,480
# 一看就地道 带鱼的香味出来了
Authentic! The aroma of the beltfish comes out.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
# 咱炸到这个程度就捞出来
Deep fry the fish rolls until they looks like this, and get them out.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
# 然后还得复炸一遍
And fry them one more time.

122
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,800
# 完了把牙签取下来
After that, remove the toothpicks.

123
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,680
# 漂亮
Beautiful.

124
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,080
# 大爷讲话好漂亮
As Da ye said, it’s beautiful.

125
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,360
# 好漂亮啊
Surely.

126
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,760
# 你看这油炸完以后多新
Look how fresh the oil is even after the frying.

127
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
# 吹干吹的好
Because we did a good job air-drying.

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
# 把牙签去掉
Remove the toothpicks.

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
# 因为你要是直接炸定型
Because if you leave those toothpicks in all the way till the end,

130
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,600
# 牙签不好取了 扎在里头了
They would be difficult to take out.

131
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,080
# 这次油温就是七成热的油温下
Now the temperature is 70% (210°C).

132
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
# 复炸的时候油温要升高一些
The second time, the oil temperature is higher.

133
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,840
# 差不多了吧
Is it good?

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
# 现在就可以搁冰箱了
Now put it into the fridge.

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
