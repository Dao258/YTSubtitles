# Master chefs of Chinese state banquet teach you how to cook fish- flavored crispy prawns, crispy shell with bouncy meat, rich taste, and low cost homemade .
# 描述
# 小友们好，今天给大家带来一道与众不同的酥皮虾。
# Hey, fellows. Today we are bringing you guys a unique version of crispy prawns.
# 酥皮虾大家应该很常见，
# Crispy prawns is a relatively ordinary dish to us,
# 但今天的特别之处在于两边腹开的改刀方式，
# But today, we use a special carving method that exposes the prawns’ belly area.
# 将虾壳与虾肉完整剥离又相连，油炸后的虾壳被保留完整，
# Separate the shell from the meat, but don’t let it totally come off. Preserve the shell after fried.
# 颜色红亮又剔透，虾壳酥脆，虾肉鲜嫩。整个菜变得非常漂亮。
# The prawn will have a bright color with a crystal look. Inside, the meat is fresh and tender, which covered by a layer of deep-fried crispy shell. The whole dish looks extremely wonderful.
# 还有个不同之处是鱼香味的蘸碟。
# And another different part is its fish-flavored ingredient.
# 为何要做蘸碟，而不是将调料汁撒在虾面上呢？
# Why do we choose to have ingredient after cooking instead of pre-cooking?
# 欢迎小友们观看视频，多学一些小技巧！
# Welcome you to watch the video and learn some skills.
