# 这招绝对棒
It’s totally working.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,200
# 好看吧 金黄
Look at the golden color

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,000
# 你听这声音震脑子都
Listen to the crispy crackling sound.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,120
# 香酥鸭
Fragrant Crispy Duck

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,600
# 但是今天我也改良了一下
I’m making some improvement to this dish today.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,640
# 叫香酥去骨鸭 脱骨了给
I am going to debone it.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,400
# 香酥鸭本身来讲
Traditionally

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,720
# 按道理是带骨头的
We should not remove the bones

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,680
# 因为在酒店
But in our restaurant (popular among foreigners)

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,160
# 老外对带骨头的东西不太感兴趣
Non-Chinese guests do not like meat with bones.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,000
# 这是鸭骚 得去掉
This part smells really bad, we have to remove it.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,120
# 这是什么鸭 这是樱桃谷鸭小鸭子
(What breed is this duck?)
Small Peking Duck

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,840
# 老外吃带骨的头不灵
Foreigners don’t like meat with bones.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,480
# 我们在操作当中就把骨头去掉
So let’s remove the bones already.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
# 我再检查底下里头啊
Let me check the inside

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
# 肺啊肠子看还有没有
Maybe the lungs and intestines are still there

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,240
# 还真不错挺干净的
Nice, it’s properly cleaned

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,360
# 我抠过了
I checked it already

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,600
# 还有呢 这儿得剌一下
We also have to make a cut here

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,880
# 食管 我也给抽过了
I have also removed the windpipe

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,440

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,560
# 最后一个环节
The last step

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,840
# 没洗鸭鼻涕吧 没有
See, you forgot to clean the nose
(indeed)

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,960
# 你看 得给师父留一点 挤一下
See? You have to leave something for your master
(Just squeeze it)

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
# 收拾干净以后我们先撮盐
After cleaning, we need to rub some salt on it.

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,880
# 今天咱鸭子是蒸 蒸煮都行
Are we gonna steam it?
(Both steaming and boiling are fine)

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,480
# 蒸的立整 煮的水气大 对
Steaming will be neater than boiling. Boiling may make it watery.
(Right)

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,160
# 搓盐入味是吧 腌制
Rub the salt evenly to marinate it

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,000
# 尤其这个鸭腿多给揉搓揉搓
Especially around the legs, you need to rub it well.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,560
# 过去咱们做香酥鸡香酥鸭
We use to make both chicken and duck like this

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,680
# 三叔 的那一句话怎么说的
Remember what I always say, San Shu?

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
# 一通百通
This is learning by analogy.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,560
# 香酥鸡跟香酥鸭的意思是一样的
You can use the same recipe for chicken and duck

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,760
# 搓好以后装到盆里头就要进行腌制
After rubbing it with salt, let’s put it in the bowl to marinate.

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,480
# 桂皮 大料 花椒
Cinnamon, star anise, and Sichuan pepper

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,400
# 来点小茴香吗 不要
A bit fennel seeds, maybe?
(no)

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,760
# 黄酒腌上
Yellow Chinese cooking wine

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,000
# 如果着急有半小时就可以
Marinate at least 30 mins if you are in a rush.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,560
# 但是我腌的要咸一点
You should use a bit more salt if you only marinate it for a short period of time.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,600
# 腌一小时就腌的淡一点
Use less salt if you got a whole hour for marination. 

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,880
# 隋坡你闻一下师父腌的这个味道
Sui Po, smell this.

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,840
# 从基础上味道就充足了
You have to marinate it through at the beginning.

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,200
# 跟网友要说清楚的
Let me explain to our followers

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,960
# 一会蒸的时候这些东西都不要取了
Make sure you leave everything here when you steam it.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,200
# 就原封的蒸或者煮
Leave everything in when you steam or boil.

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
# 你看隋坡老师傅做老菜
When an old master cooks a traditional dish

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,760
# 其实没那么多原料
He keeps everything simple.

50
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,720
# 就那么简单
Simple as that

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,760
# 所有的食材是借味
spices bring out the flavor of the duck

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,920
# 不是说整个鸭子就转变成
But the seasoning should not take over.

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,160
# 桂皮味什么的 那就不对了
Like, the duck should not only taste like cinnamon

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
# 对原来本味没有了
Then the natural flavor of the duck (main course) is lost.

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,640
# 鸭子也好了今天不蒸了
OK the duck is ready. We will not steam it today, though

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
# 因为咱这蒸着别的呢
The steamer is being used for some other dish.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,480
# 咱们改煮
So instead, we will boil it.

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,040
# 要蒸的话大火蒸一小时
If you were to steam it, you will need one hour on high heat.

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,640
# 这种（电）高压性质的
If you use an electronic pressure cooker

60
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,240
# 半小时就可以了
30 mins will do.

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,080
# 大爷现在往里放水了
Let’s pour the water in.

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,360
# 这水上没味我们还得补点盐
We need to add salt to it.

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,920
# 还得搁点酒
And some Chines cooking wine

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,480
# 您这到省事
That was easy.

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
# 一教网友网友回家都能做了
So that all of our followers can learn and make this at home.

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
# 你看没有四十分钟
See, in less that 40 minutes.

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,560
# 这是机器说的话
According to the machine.

68
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,640
# 鸭子已经熟了
The duck is ready.

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,160
# 你看怎么能看出鸭子烂没烂
How can you tell?

70
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,840
# 看俩腿它缩回去了
See how the legs shrank into the duck?

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
# 拿出来晾着
Take it out and let it rest.

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,360
# 这小鸭子咱们家里正好吃一个
This duck is just the right size for us today.

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,840
# 这肚子里边很重要
Pay attention to the inside of it.

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
# 把这汤给卸了
We need to pour it all out.

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,120
# 翻着 现在就可以炸
Flip it, and it’s almost ready for frying.

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,520

77
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,240
# 但是咱们说的是香酥去骨鸭
But we promised to take the bones off.

78
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,600
# 我们不香酥了我们俩就这么吃
(Forget about the frying, it’s good to eat for us already)

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,440
# 可以迫不及待了
(I can’t wait)

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,240
# 这鸭子给它晾一晾
Let it rest for a while.

81
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
# 待会我去骨
I will debone it later.

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,520
# 晾鸭子这个时间 干点啥
In the meantime

83
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,280
# 咱们炒点花椒
Let’s roast some Sichuan Peppercorns

84
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,720
# 这花椒一定是现磨
We must roast it freshly.

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
# 现焙的花椒香啊
(Freshly baked ones smells much better)

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
# 刚开始因为锅不太热开大火
We used high heat to bring the wok's temperature up.

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
# 咱们现在小火慢慢焙
Now let’s roast it on low heat.

88
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,000
# 就搁这上头 先这样晾着
Put it right here and let it rest a bit

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,120
# 晾一晾
For a little while.

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
# 一会拿擀面杖一擀
We will grind it with a rolling pin

91
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,760
# 你看原来是发红
Its color turned from red

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,160
# 现在有点发褐色了
To a bit of brown.

93
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,120
# 要这葱心 咱们切末
Now let’s chop the spring onion up.

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,280
# 这先搁一边
Put it aside

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,080
# 行啊有点劲
(Not bad, you still got the muscles)

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,320
# 不是有劲儿
Well not really

98
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,440
# 花椒潮气出去了
It’s easier to grind when it’s dried like this.

99
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,400
# 细听这个声音咔咔
Listen to the crackling sound.

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,520
# 看着啊
Watch this.

102
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,880
# 把大爷的葱又跟
So, Da Ye is mixing the spring onion

103
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,760
# 花椒大颗粒混合了
With the large pieces of the Sichuan Pepper

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,880
# 盐 这叫椒盐
Add some salt.
(This is called "the Sichuan Peppercorn Salt")

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720

106
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,720
# 这叫葱椒盐
This is called "the Sichuan Peppercorn Salt, with scallions"

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,760
# 这个很少用
This is not used very often nowadays

108
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,120
# 这是个老的调味方法
It’s an old time seasoning mix.

109
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,640
# 为什么要用葱心
Why do you only use the inner part of the spring onion?

110
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,040
# 它润的湿的
We need its moisture.

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,200
# 用那个（葱叶）还容易糊
And the green leaves burn too quickly.

112
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
# 炸完了以后容易糊
Especially if you deep fry it.

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,960
# 这俩花椒盐出来了
OK now we have both types of “Peppercorn Salt” ready.

114
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,120
# 一个葱椒盐 一个花椒盐
One with spring onion and the other one without.

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
# 下边咱们调一个糊
Next, we need to make a batter.

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
# 网友们 大爷做菜简单漂亮
(See? Da Ye was always making it simple but beautiful)

117
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,200
# 在家容易上手
(Easy to follow at home)

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,600
# 面粉 还有搁点淀粉
(Egg), Flour, and some starch

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,560

120
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
# 说着说着这边就和上水了
(Mix it with water)

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,560
# 这个糊调好了
(OK the batter is ready)

122
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,160
# 不光是鸡蛋 还要加点水
We added both egg and water.

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
# 两份面粉 一份淀粉
Two portions of flour and one portion of starch.

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,520
# 二比一 它起什么作用呢
Why is it 2:1 ?

125
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,360
# 外边有点酥 挺实酥脆立得住
To make sure that it crisp up while maintaining its shape after frying.

126
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,960
# 这个工作准备好了
OK the preparation is done.

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,040
# 下一步开始拆鸭子
Now, let’s remove the bones.

128
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
# 这些东西都要弄走
We need to clean it up.

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
# 不弄走容易上当
Otherwise it might get you later.

130
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,040
# 下锅一炸的时候它崩
it may pop in the oil

131
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,200

132
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,240
# 把水给它它沾干
Wipe the excess moisture out.

133
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280

134
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,240
# 鸭子很酥烂
The duck has been fully cooked 

135
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,480
# 把这水管子开开  还烫
Get the water running, it’s still hot.

136
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,400

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
# 去骨是从脊背
We start from the back

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,120
# 先把鸭脖子去掉
First remove the neck

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,120
# 一扽往下一撸 走人
And then just take it up like that, voilà!

140
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,040

141
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,160
# 全下来了
Here it gose.

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
# 脊背的肉 大骨已经去掉了
The bones in the back is removed.

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
# 我开始剔鸭胸的骨头
I’ll now take care of the ribs.

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,600
# 这个最好是晾凉了以后再拆有型
It’s better to debone it when it’s completely cooled off, so that it can stay better in shape.

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,760
# 其实这小脆骨也挺好吃的
(These cartilages also taste very nice)

146
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,200

147
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,160
# 按着走
Keep pressing the meat

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,440

149
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,160
# 一会我吃这个
I’ll eat that later.

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,360
# 为什么要脱一个糊
Why do we need the batter?

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
# 你看这拆完以后
Well, after we have removed the bones,

152
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,640
# 鸭肉有的个别的可能会烂
Some parts of the meat may fall off

153
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
# 因为它很酥
Because we have cooked it through.

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,040
# 这个酥叫酥烂的这种酥法
You know, almost falling off the bones.

155
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,960
# 这块叫胸叉骨
This is the wishbone.

156
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,480
# 你看烂乎乎的别着急
(Don’t worry if it looks as if it’s all falling apart.)

158
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,440
# 呈现出来的最后还美
(It will look alright at the end)

159
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,800
# 吸水的目的就是待会
We need to remove the excessive moisture

160
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
# 挂糊的时候挂得住
So that the batter can stick with the meat.

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
# 不吸就变成稀糊了
Otherwise it may get too soggy.

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,400

163
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,040
# 你看这个当补丁给补上
Let me fill this up.

164
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,080
# 哪厚的哪薄的一点问题没有了
Alright it is now all even.

165
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
# 刚才我尝尝这鸭肉稍微淡点
I tasted it just now, it needs a bit more salt

166
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,840
# 来了葱椒盐
Here, the pepper salt with spring onion.

167
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
# 你看见没有
(See that)

168
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,640
# 大爷的事在这儿
(That’s the trick)

169
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,560
# 比如说外边吃个烤羊腿
Sometimes when you roast the leg of a lamb.

170
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,600
# 外边焦嫩但里边没味
Roasted nicely crispy outside, but it may lack some flavor inside.

171
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
# 剩了不少怎么办
What are you going to do with the leftover meat?

172
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,040
# 把葱椒盐往羊肉里边一抹
Put this on

173
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,840
# 外边挂一个糊 一炸
Make a batter, and fry.

174
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,200
# 大爷教你们奇妙的招
(Secret tip from Da Ye)

175
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,040
# 这招是绝对棒
(This is absolutely amazing)

176
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,160
# 三叔点火
San Shu, fire it up.

177
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
# 倒油
Oil

178
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,400
# 三叔咱也不过日子了
(That’s a lot of oil but I don’t care )

179
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,160
# 拍拍干粉易于挂糊
Coat it with some dry flour so that the batter can stick to it.

180
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,960
# 上糊下粉 大爷厉害
(Batter on the top and flour at the bottom. Nice!)

181
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,720
# 正合适 我这个干活比较靠谱
I am quite serious about it.

182
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520

183
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
# 咱们油温大概在四成啊五成啊
What is the oil temperature? 130-150 ℃?

184
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,120
# 得七成 上来就定型
We need it around 200 ℃, so that the meat will keep the original shape 

185
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,440
# 因为咱这鸭子是热的
Also, because our duck is still warm.

186
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,040
# 所以油温就高一点
So, it’s alright to use a higher temperature.

187
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,200
# 凉鸭子搁了一宿了那就得五成六成
But if you fry it after cooling it overnight, then you should use a lower temperature of around 150℃

188
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,520
# 刨出来了啊
(Now you know the secret!)

189
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,960
# 先定型 定完型以后再升温
First fix the shape, then we can let the temperature go up a bit.

190
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,480
# 再一炸 倍儿酥
Fry again, to make it extra crispy.

191
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,800

192
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,960
# 非常好下锅了
Good, let’s fry it

193
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
# 因为家里边一个是锅小
Sometimes you only have a small pan at home.

195
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
# 油可能不会用这么多
And perhaps you don’t want to use that much oil in the pan.

196
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,520
# 我们可以把这鸭子分成两半
You can also cut it in half.

197
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
# 家有家的做法饭店有饭店的做法
You don’t have to do it in the professional way, like what we do in the restaurant.

198
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,200
# 油升一下温 二次复炸
Heat it up and fry for the second time.

199
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,360
# 这是什么啊 起酥
(What’s that for? To crisp it up.)

200
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,240
# 冒烟了准备复炸
(It’s smoking now, time to fry.)

201
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,640

202
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,880
# 这属于大鼻涕泡
(The large bubbles means)

203
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
# 温度就正好
That it is at the right temperature.

204
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,200
# 你看这怎么样 非常好
What do you think?
(Very good)

205
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,640
# 好看吧 金黄
Isn’t that beautiful.
(Beautiful golden color)

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
# 马上就出锅了
Almost ready

207
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,240
# 其实这么炸也快
(It is quite fast to fry it this way.)

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,600
# 刚做完了以后吃
(You can enjoy it right afterwards)

209
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,960
# 吃出鸭子的鲜味来
(You can taste the freshness of the duck)

210
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,000

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
# 炸出金黄色
Get the golden color on.

212
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,120

213
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,280
# 开始装盘了
Let’s start plating.

214
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,320
# 给它翻过来装 看着就酥
Flip it over
(You can see how crispy it is)

215
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,280
# 闻着香啊 修边啊
Smells amazing
(Let’s trim it)

216
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,960
# 待会我吃边
(I will eat these edges.)

217
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,640
# 我这从来不剩头 您是垫底儿呢给
I never waste anything
(Are you going to put it underneath?)

218
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,080
# 你看见没有大爷做菜就是样
(See? That’s how a real master like Da Ye cooks)

219
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,960
# 把边上先切了 小象眼刀
(He is chopping the side parts first)

220
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,800

221
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,960
# 你听这酥不酥 震脑子都
Can you hear the crackling sound?

222
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080

223
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
# 香味出来了啊
(Smells amazing.)

224
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,880
# 尤其是这葱椒盐的味儿
Especially the smell from the pepper salt and spring onion.

225
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,840
# 货卖一张皮是吧
It’s all about the presentations！

226
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,760
# 鸭胸是最好的一块肉
The breast is the best part of the duck.

227
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,680
# 听这的声音
(listen to that)

228
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240

229
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,600
# 沙沙的
(The crackling sound)

230
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
# 您给我蘸一个椒盐的吧
Can you dip that piece in the Sichuan peppercorn salt for me?

231
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,920

232
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,600
# 甘香酥脆
Sweet, fragrant, tender, and crispy.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
# 真是甘香酥脆 肉软嫩
(It truly is.)

234
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,280
# 还脆呢
It is still crispy.

235
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,720
# 鸭子脏腥味没有 绝了
(All the bad smell from the duck is gone, amazing)

236
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
# 谢谢 谢谢
(thanks thanks)

237
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
# 得嘞
(Alright!)

238
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,160
# 极好吃啊极好吃
Absolutely delicious.

239
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,560
