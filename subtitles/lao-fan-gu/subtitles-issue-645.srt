# Title:[San-Bei Chicken] Classic dish from Taiwan, featuring tender chicken, aroma of rice wine that will fill the whole room!

# 描述
# 小友们好，今天给大家带来台菜的代表性菜品：三杯鸡。

# 三杯鸡这道菜发源于江西省，后流传并发扬于台湾，成为台菜的代表性菜品。

# 三杯鸡是江西省地方传统名菜，相传与民族英雄文天祥有关。
# 因烹制时不放汤水，仅用米酒一杯、猪油或茶油一杯、酱油一杯，故得名。
# 但因三杯鸡做法多样，版本颇多，今天呢咱们做的是老饭骨的邓氏三杯鸡。

# 取三黄鸡，不去骨，将鸡切成小块后开始清洗，
# 其中清洗是非常重要的一步，因为决定了煎出的鸡是否黄亮。
# 洗净后开始腌制。

# 三杯鸡的点睛之笔的三杯汁应如何配制？
# 香油，米酒和酱油的配比是怎样的呢？
# 香油，米酒，酱油这三杯应该什么时候放呢？
# 三杯鸡的灵魂：罗勒叶应该什么时候放呢？
# 黄酒煨锅边儿是什么操作？砂锅，黄酒和菜会出现什么样的化学碰撞？
# 那叫一个香呀！感兴趣的小友记得学呀！

# Hi everyone, we present one of the most iconic dishes from Taiwan: San Bei (three-cup) Chicken.
# Originally this is a dish was rooted in Jiangxi, and was brought to Taiwan and became an iconic dish there.
# Story goes that this dish was a traditional dish in Jiangxi and is connected with the famous historical hero Wen Tianxiang. The name of this dish comes from its special recipe: no water needed. One cup of rice wine, one cup of pork or tea-seed oil and one cup of soy sauce, that’s all we need. There are many versions of this famous dish, we are making the one in the style of our own.

# Chop the chicken into small pieces and clean it before marination. Cleaning is very important for the colorisation during cooking.

# What’s the most important step in making the cause? What’s the best ratio between the ingredients? When do we need to add sesame the three cups of ingredients? When should you put the Thai basil leaves? What is the proper technique to add Chinese rice wine (Huangjiu)? What would happen when the clay pot meets the rice wine and the ingredients?

# The amazing aroma of this dish is so amazing that everyone should learn to cook it.

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,840
# 然后我们加一杯（生抽） 差不多了
So lastly a cup of soy sauce.

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,600
# 如果说你生抽倒一 必定太咸了
It would be too salty if soy sauce is the same portion as others.

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,160
# 蚝油可以下上十五克到二十克
about 15-20 grams of oyster sauce

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
# 都没关系

# 其实这个菜真正的东西它在这儿

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,400
# 还是说一通百通用口味来变通

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,720
# 咱下香油咱们先下一半
We will first use half of the sesame oil

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,280

# 把它的香气全面慢慢逼出来
Get the aroma out

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,600
# 逼到哪里呢逼到油里
And infuse the flavour to the oil.

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
# 小火慢煎
Low heat, fry slowly.

87
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,240
# 葱姜不炸永远不香 搁点蒜
Ginger and leek needs to be fried for the maximum flavour. Garlics in now.

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,200
# 咱们第二次把油下进去

91
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,320
# 咱这个蒜子你看稍微有点微黄了

# 可以把火开大一点没事没关系
The heat can go higher, that’s fine.

94
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,240
# 家里火还是慢 鸡肉有点出水
The heat at our home kitchen is still a bit weak, the moisture is coming out of the meat.

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,520
# 家里就这条件咱们火力不够
Well that’s the best we can do at home

96
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,960
# 这一面基本上颜色已经快变了

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,120
# 下边又是葱姜蒜加上麻油

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,920
# 再点一滴老抽 上上色
Some dark soy sauce for the colour.

110
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,680
# 放冰糖 十一二克
Crystal sugar, 11-12 grams.

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,040
# 再来一小把
A pinch more.

112
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,480
# 这个菜出来是咸甜还是甜咸
Is this dish mainly featuring sweetness or saltiness?

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,960
# 咸甜 就是咸压甜 对了
Salty, and a bit of sweetness.

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,040
# 好了师父咱们呢转进砂锅

# 把砂锅烧一下底
Let’s pre-heat the pot.

117
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,600
# 烧一烧然后把它挪过去
And then we pour the dish in.

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,200
# 烧热了砂锅里边不用垫点东西么
Do we need to put something in it when it’s hot?

119
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,920
# 不用 垫点儿羊肉
You know, something like lamb?

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,680
# 有酒用砂锅出的的香味浓
The rice wine elevates the flavour in the clay pot.

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,880
# 所以说一定要用砂锅 加盖
So we must use clay pot, with lid on.

122
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
# 歇一分钟收收汁
Let me take a break for a minute while it cooks.

123

# 这火合适
The heat is fine.

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,680
# 要有耐心

# 想要吃好的味道一定要有耐心
It takes time to cook a proper dish and to achieve the desired flavour.

126
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,560

127
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,720

# 那么我们现在放点配色的
Now, it’s time for some colour in it.

130

# 这一下三杯鸡的特色一下出来了
Now that’s a proper san-bei chicken

132
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,880
# 没有它就是不行
You can’t cook a san-bei chicken without it.

133
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,080
# 亮师兄你看这鸡的颜色了吗

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
# 我看着呢我口水都要流出来了
I am, and it’s making me drool.

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,040
# 还有一个工序
One more step

136
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,320
# 我们把盖再盖上
Let’s put the lid back on.

137
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,920
# 这是师父教我的一个方式
I learnt it from my master.

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,720
# 围着这锅边 倒多少
Pour the wine around the lid. (How much?)

139
