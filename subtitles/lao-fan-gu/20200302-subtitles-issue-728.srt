# 标题：【国宴大师•妙辣水煮鱼】绝妙家常菜：辣而不燥，麻而不苦，香气四溢的水煮鱼，在家吃得就得过瘾！
# Title: [State Banquet Master Chef-Fish Boiled with Special Spicy Soup]

# 简介：
# 小友们好！几位小饭骨趁我们哥仨不在，终于大展身手了回儿，准备教大家做个热门家常菜，一家子都能吃过瘾的妙辣水煮鱼。
# 为什么叫妙辣水煮鱼呢，小焦说“妙由百味生”，换句话呢就是调料多。
# 操作已经很熟悉了啊。因为是在家吃，选一条普通草鱼即可，洗完之后擦擦水（为何擦水呢？），再去掉草鱼的刺（如何去除？），擦去粘液方便将于切片。加入盐，葱姜，黄酒，水淀粉，大概腌制20来分钟。
# 热锅凉油下，这次咱加点儿猪油，更香。下入葱姜蒜煸香，加入郫县豆瓣酱，加入八角，三粒，豆蔻，
# 在下，丁香，草果，陈皮，香叶，桂皮，白芷，熬制差不多后加入普通辣椒。（普通辣椒作用为提香）加入水之后熬个20多分钟，小火慢熬，但熬制一半时要加入辣椒面和花椒。
# 有小友会问 ”为何要在中间儿加呢？”
# 答：若刚开始加辣椒面儿容易糊，花椒早放麻度会衰减。
# 花椒和麻椒小友们可别弄混了啊，作用并不相同。
# 所有的辣椒在炸之前为何都需要焯遍水呢？
# 好了啊，操作方法你们还是在视频中学习吧！
# 这道菜做出红亮养眼，辣而不燥，麻而不苦。让你“麻上头，辣过瘾”。简直妙不可言！
# 此刻你们的胃有没有很寂寞？赶快起锅开灶，盘它…
# 最后，有小友或许会说，调料用得太多了，但我们一直鼓励大家一通百通，所以小友们家里有什么就用什么哦！
# Intro
# Hi everyone. As all the masters are not home, we finally got the chance to show our special skills. Today we are preparing a “special” spicy fish dish to satisfy a whole family of chili lovers.
# What’s so special about this dish? According to chef Jiao, it’s special when you have a lot of flavors going on. In other words, we need A LOT of ingredients for this dish.
# It’s quite easy to prepare. We use grass carp, which is commonly available. We need to wipe off the excess water after cleaning the fish (why?), then we will remove the bones (how) and the cut the fish into slices. Then we will marinate it for about 20 minutes with salt, ginger, spring onion, yellow Chinese rice wine, and starch.
# Then, we heat up the wok and pour some cold oil in. We even used some pork fat to intensify the aroma. Fry the spring onion, garlic and ginger in the wok with some Doubanjiang (Sichuan chili bean paste), some star anise, and nutmeg. Then, we put cloves, tsao-ko, dried mandarin peels, bay leaves, cinnamon, baizhi (Angelica dahurica) in and fry for a while, then we add chili pepper and water to cook for about 20 minutes on low heat. After 10 minutes we need to add chili flakes and Sichuan pepper.
# Why do we add them in the middle of the boiling process? To prevent the chili flakes to get burned, also to keep the numbing taste of the Sichuan pepper.
# Also, remember there are different types of Sichuan pepper and we use them for different purposes.
# Also, we will let you know why you should soak the chili peppers before frying tiem.
# Pay attention and learn about all the details in our video.
# This dish comes with a pleasant red color, features a spicy and numbing taste without being too overwhelming or bitter. It will surely satisfy your desire for spiciness. Get your gears going if you are feeling hungry!
# Maybe you do not have all those spices we used, that’s fine, just improvise a bit and use whatever you have in stock.

# 三成热 慢慢把这香味
Cook it slowly on low heat

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
# 都得给浸泡出来
And let it release all the aroma

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,920
# 然后下边我们就依次放入
Now, we need the spices

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,040
# 八角 三粒 豆蔻

# 都放里了

# 十五粒小茴香
About fifteen fennel seeds

59
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
# 先放硬的东西
The hard spices will go in first

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,480
# 为什么先放硬的原材料
Why?

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,120
# 硬的原材料禁熬
Because they can handle more cooking time

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
# 丁香 草果
Cloves, tsao-ko

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,960

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,040
# 咱们该放什么呢 辣椒
What’s next? Chili pepers

70
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,560
# 这个是普通辣椒
We have here the common dried chili peppers

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,440
# 整颗放就行 有十五个
We need about 15 pieces.

72
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,760
# 辣椒王 咱们少放一点
Now, the really spicy “Chili King”, let’s not put too much of it.

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,840
# 普通的辣椒提香
So the common ones are for the aroma

74
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,520
# 辣椒王是增加辣度厚度
While the “Chili King” is for an intensive spiciness.

75
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,840
# 加醋吗 不加
Vinegar? No not today.

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,960
# 师兄咱们哥仨就不加了
We really don’t need to argue about that between us

77
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,280
# 怎么着也得斗起来了
Not like the masters.

78
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,960
# 慢慢加热水 先来一勺
Let’s pour in the hot water slowly. Bit by bit.

79
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
# 需要加几次啊
How much do we need?

80
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,640
# 咱们把这小盆都倒进去就行
This whole bowl.

81
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,160
# 这会就等着开了锅
Now, let’s wait until its boiling.

82
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,840
# 咱们给它煮一煮
And let it boil for a while

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,080

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,480
# 大约熬几分钟
A few minutes

85
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,360
# 大概熬个二十分钟
Maybe around 20 minutes

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
# 小火慢熬 好嘞
Keep it boiling on low heat

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,480
# 师兄咱们煮到一半的时候
After about 10 minutes

88
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,680
# 咱们加点原材料 加什么呢
We need to add more ingredients to it

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
# 一个是辣椒面
First the chili flakes

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
# 还有两种花椒
Then two types of Sichuan pepper

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
# 为什么说中间加
Why do we put them in in the middle of the boiling process?

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,640
# 这就是妙处所在
That’s the special part too.

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,240
# 因为你刚开始加的时候
If you add the chili flakes too early,

94
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
# 辣椒面就糊了
It might become soggy. (这里我觉得他说的糊应该是煮的时间太长了糊了？)

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,920
# 所以说中间加辣椒面 加一半
That’s why we add it half way during boiling.

96
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,040
# 花椒着油之后虽然说更香
Indeed the Sichuan peppers smells better after frying

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
# 但是把麻度和香度都减弱了
But frying also reduces the aroma and the numbing taste

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,880
# 有所衰减 中间放
That’s why we also only put them in during the boiling process.

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
# 网友朋友们
Dear friends

100
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,200
# 这个麻椒和花椒是两种概念
There are two different types of Sichuan peppers

101
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,680
# 花椒是增香
Huajiao is one used for its aroma

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,440
# 麻椒是增麻度和厚度
And Majiao is the one used to intensify the numbing taste

103
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,720
# 香度也够了
Alright it smells good already

104
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,480
# 咱们给它过过箩
Let’s pass it through the sieve

105
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
# 来吧师弟我扶着
I got it.

106
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,160
# 要配合的好
That requires some cooperation

107
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,800
# 有吹笛儿的有捏眼儿的
Good teamwork right there!

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,480
# 这会儿咱们汤熬好了
OK now the spicy soup is ready

109
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,240
# 鱼腌的也差不多了
Fish is marinated too.

110
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,960
# 这是小料 事先切好的
Here are some extra ingredients I prepared earlier

111
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,720
# 姜末 蒜末 小葱段儿
Ginger, garlic, spring onion

112
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,840
# 姜片儿 干葱 辣椒段

113
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,960
# 青笋 大白菜 黑木耳
Celtuce, Chinese cabbage, black mushroom

114
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,880
# 莴笋好吃啊
I love celtuce

115
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
# 这水煮鱼啊
This is a fish dish

116
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,520
# 这里头这菜好 入味啊
But the vegetables in it are also delicious

117
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,160
# 有的在家说愿意把菜焯水
Some prefer to first cook the vegetables with boiling water.

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
# 但是我今天做我就不焯水了
I am not doing that today

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
# 直接炒先给它炒一遍
I will just stir fry it directly.

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
# 增加了锅气
It gives more “wok-hei”

121
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,200
# 稍微来点油 小干葱 辣椒段
A bit of oil, shallots in with dried chili pepper

122
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,880
# 这时候火关小一点
Let’s turn down the heat

123
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
# 稍微来点麻椒和花椒
A little bit of both types of Sichuan peppers

124
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,280
# 来一点豆瓣酱 小豆瓣
A little bit of Doubanjiang

125
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
# 这会儿把菜放进去
Vegetables in.

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,400
# 小锅翻的溜
Your pan flipping skills is pretty good!

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,480
# 稍微烹点刚才咱们熬那个汁
Pour a bit of the spicy soup in.

128
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,440
# 来点盐 来点糖
Salt, and sugar

129
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,000
# 这个里边为什么加点糖
Why do we need sugar?

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
# 辣的东西一定要加糖
Sugar goes well with spicy dishes

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,760
# 加糖才有复合味
It adds complicity to the flavor

132
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,640
# 如果不加糖是寡辣
Otherwise you only taste the spiciness.

133
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,280
# 这回菜熟的差不多了
OK the vegetables are cooked

134
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,880
# 咱们给它倒到碗里 垫底儿的菜
Let’s put them at the bottom of the bowl

135
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,840
# 刚才熬那汤 倒进去
Pour the spicy soup in the wok.

136

# 都煮到一起了就 分开下
The slices will stick to each other. You must do it one by one.

# 你看这会儿这鱼片非常的饱满
See? The slices are nicely thick

142
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,720
# 鱼片的表面淀粉遇热会凝结

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,640

# 看这鱼片 特别的整

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,880
# 所有的辣椒你在炸之前

# 因为不焯水的话

# 它会糊的很快 糊就苦了
