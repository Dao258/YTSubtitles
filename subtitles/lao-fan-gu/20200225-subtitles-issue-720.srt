00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,680
# 把那肉稍微要有焦感
Pork pieces should be slightly brown and crispy

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
# 它才会有焦香味 对
So they can develop that fragrance from caramelisation

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,160
# 到这份上就可以了
It’s right on spot now

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,400
# 下酱不能全下去
You can’t pour all paste in at once

# 一边炒一边下
You must add it in batches

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
# 就都能把酱炸透了
So it can be thoroughly fried

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,040
# 你如果一倒进去就咕嘟了
If you pour all of the paste into the pan, it will become boiled

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,720
# 做饭手法很重要 程序

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,480
# 很多人为什么味道会差一点
A lot of dishes are not as tasty

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,920
# 程序弄错 香味提不出来
Because they messed up the procedures, so the fragrance was not lifted

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
# 分三次下
Add it in three batches

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,120
# 最后剩一点 这个就不能加凉水
For the last bit, you can’t mix it with cold water

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,640
# 因为它会降温
Because it will cause the temperature to drop

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
# 在这个过程中就可以提一点糖
Add in a little bit of sugar in the meantime

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680

It acts like MSG

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,080
# 而且糖有个好处
Also, sugar has an extra benefit

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,280
# 可以让色泽更漂亮

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,520
# 就见着它的主材
You must see the main ingredients of a dish

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,040
# 一搁肉沫就不好吃了这东西很怪
It would be tasteless and weird if you put pork mince in this dish

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,320
# 色香味俱全
Now it’s colourful, fragrant and tasty

43
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,000

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,040
# 炸酱不要着急

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
# 它是一态度问题
It’s attitude

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,600
# 你态度好炸出酱就好
If you are patient, the sauce will be perfect in return

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,720
# 你要态度不好着急
On the contrary, if you have a bad temper

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
# 肉也腥酱也不熟
The meat will be smelly, and the sauce will not be properly cooked

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
# 前期炒的时候你记住一定用这火
Remember to use such heat when you first fry them

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,480

51
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,160
# 慢慢澥慢慢收
Slowly dilute the sauce and then slowly thicken it

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600

Render the fat out of the meat

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,760
# 然后逼进酱里
And then push it back to the sauce

54
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,520

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,440

Now turn down to low heat

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
# 慢慢慢慢的㸆
Braise the sauce really slowly

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,640

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
# 这肉块也比我们家大
These meat pieces are bigger than what we usually use

61
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,200
# 对你们家不舍得
