# 【国宴大师•糖醋排骨】人人都能做的家庭版：为何糖醋排骨离不开蒜？这样做排骨色红味酸甜还香酥！|老饭骨
# 描述
# Family Version Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs! Why is garlic a must?
# 小友们好，之前有朋友想要看家庭版的糖醋排骨，
# 我们分享了川菜大师黎师傅的川味糖醋排骨的做法，
# 这道菜其实每个菜系都有，
# 但咱老饭骨一直也提倡一通百通，好吃才是王道。

# 今天呢，二伯徒弟，老冯，就教大家做老冯家常版的糖醋排骨，
# 糖醋的化学碰撞会有什么样的火花呢？
# 糖醋排骨的排骨应该怎样选？油温几成时开始下排骨？
# 如何判断炸排骨的油温？高油温为何会比低油温更适合炸排骨？
# 或许有小友问：糖醋排骨的炒糖与我们平日的炒糖色有什么区别呢？
# 答：可千万不能超过了，这里的炒糖要求的是金黄色。
# 炒糖是有油炒法，水油混炒和水炒法，
# 但咱们的做法是油炒法，
# 将糖炒至金黄之后下入排骨和切好的蒜，
# 排骨上色之后再放入去腥增香的姜片，
# 再放入葱段儿，葱味儿出来之后加入米醋，
# 火候调小，点点盐和酱油，二次加糖，
# 这次加糖和第一步炒糖的区别在哪呢？
# 最后，加入稀释后的黄酒，火调小，入味儿，
# 15分钟后取出料头，三次调味，开大火，收汁儿，就成啦！

# 小友们，这道菜真不难，就是三次调味步骤细致点儿，
# 成菜色泽枣红，口味酸甜，学这么道作拿手菜，给家人露一手吧！

# import intro （请在稿件中保留此行不要改动）
# Hi everyone, some fans would like to learn how to cook sweet and sour pork ribs at home.
# We are now sharing this recipe from Chef Li, a grandmaster chef in Sichuan cuisine.
# This dish is in all Chinese cuisines. If you can master it, the rest will follow.
# Delicious taste is always the spirit of every dish.

# Chef Feng (disciple of Er Bai) is going to teach us his homemade sweet and sour pork ribs.
# What kind of chemical reaction will be produced after sweetness joins sourness?
# What kind of ribs should we choose? What is the correct oil temperate for cooking ribs?
# How to tell if the oil temperature is suitable for deep-frying? Why is a high oil temperature better for deep frying?
# Maybe some of you will ask: what is the difference between the caramel in sweet-sour ribs and regular caramelized sugar?
# The answer is the golden caramel is the one we want for this dish, not the over-cooked one.
# There are various ways to produce caramel. You can stir fry sugar with oil, water or both.
# But, this time we are going to fry sugar with oil.
# Stir-fry sugar till golden, add in deep fried pork ribs and garlic.
# After the pork ribs are perfectly colored, add in ginger slices for odor removal.
# Then add in spring onion chunks, bring the flavour out, and then pour some rice vinegar.
# Reduce the heat, season the dish with a bit of salt, soy sauce and sugar for the second time.
# So, what is the difference between this time and the previous time we add sugar?
# Finally, add in some diluted huangjiu (yellow rice wine), reduce the heat again and wait for flavour penetration.
# After 15 mins, remove the aromatics, season the dish for the third time, and condense the sauce on high heat. And Bravo!

# To all my fans, this is an easy to learn dish but we need to be patient with the triple-seasoning process.
# The dish should have a maroon glaze, and a sweet and sour flavour！
# Please master this dish and amaze your family with it!

# 然后我这么多年是用
What I normally do in these years is braising pork ribs with sugar and vinegar.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,680

14

# 剩下这头干嘛用
What should we do with meat scraps?

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
# 这是您喜欢吃的脆骨

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,040
# 这段就是做糖醋排骨最好的
This part is the most suitable ingredients for our dish.

20

# 一刀俩 口儿大一点吧
Chop into two. A bigger chop

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,800
# 过瘾 今天咱们不要细 要味儿

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,360
# 那就一破为二了啊
I’ll chop them into two pieces.

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,600

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,080
# 咱们把排骨搁这儿
Put ribs aside.

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
# 用水给它浸泡一下
Soak them in water.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,440
# 泡个半个小时就行
For half an hour or so.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,000
# 把里边有血水的给它往外拔一拔
This process will draw out some blood from the meat.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,080
# 然后这个工夫咱们准备点料
We can prepare other ingredients while we are waiting.

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,400
# 葱段一点要选葱白
White part of scallion.

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,880
# 它做烧菜比较出味
It adds more flavour into our dish.

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,440
# 然后还不容易破型
And they don't break down.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,640
# 然后咱们就直接切成段就行了
Chop them into pieces

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
# 跟排骨这么长就可以了
Similar length as pork ribs

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,200
# 反正有这三段就够了
Three pieces are enough.

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,280
# 一定要整一点这料
We need the aromatics to be chunky

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,600
# 因为待会咱们料要挑出来的
As we're gonna pick them out later.

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,200
# 我们专业叫吃其味不见其物
We have a saying in our profession. Seasonings and aromatics should be tasted but not (physically) found in the dish.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,160
# 姜大一点
More gingers please.

39
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,680
# 还有黄冰糖 大料瓣
Add some brown rock sugar, star anise

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,160
# 蒜呢 蒜在这儿
Where is garlic? Here is it!

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,200
# 我当你说做糖醋不放蒜  吓我一跳
Gosh, I thought you were gonna skip the garlic. No way!

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
# 然后蒜也不用太多了一破两半吧
We don’t need too many garlic, just cut the cloves in to halves.

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,440
# 你们做些东西尽量
When you are producing this dish,

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
# 我主张你们不要去拍
I suggest that you don't smash the garlic,

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,360
# 一定要用刀切
but chop it.

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,120
# 刀切不损害它汁儿
Chopping will keep the garlic juice

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,520
# 然后做出菜来显得干净
And the presentation is much cleaner.

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,240
# 我倒了一碗醋 米醋
I poured one bowl of vinegar, rice vinegar.

49
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
# 米醋和糖的比例是多少
what’s the ratio between sugar and vinegar?

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,600
# 糖是三 醋是二
3 part sugar and 2 part vinegar

51
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,680
# 甜压酸 稍微偏甜一点
We need more sugar, as sugar can neutralize the sour flavour.

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
# 半个小时以后这排骨还真白了
Ribs turn lighter colour after half an hour indeed.

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,320
# 排骨洗完了底口来一勺盐
Wash and clean the ribs. Sprinkle some salt.

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,480
# 五克盐 给它抓一下
5g salt. Massage the ribs.

55
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,800
# 咱们这儿腌的时候就不搁
We don’t need to put this now.

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
# 待会儿咱们烧的时候
Later when we start braising ribs,

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,040
# 我得需要您一点黄油来借它的味
I need to add some cooking wine (Shaoxing wine)

58
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,520
# 弄两块钱的 五毛钱就行
- Use the 2RMB one
- The 0.5 RMB one is enough

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,800
# 这个盐抓一下起什么作用师弟
Why do we need to massage the ribs with salt?

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,600
# 让它基本的入味 要有底口
Add some basic flavour into them.

61
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,320
# 师父我跟我讲盐是定味的
My master told me salt can set up basic flavour to meat.

62
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,600
# 先把盐入进排骨里头
Meat absorbs salt,

63
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
# 把味给它定住 定海神针
saltiness is locked into the ribs

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,600
# 好这油温开始陆续地升起来
alright. The oil is heating up.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,280
# 现在这里边有一个关键
Now, there is a key step.

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,640
# 八角 你看这就是秘方
Star anise is our secret ingredient.

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,080
# 因为我岳父最爱吃糖醋排骨
This is my father-in-law’s favourite dish.

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,200
# 把岳父搬出来了
So, you start using your father-in-law as a shield.
(So you quoted your father-in-law)

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
# 我平常给他家里边做的时候
I cook this dish in exactly the same way

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
# 就是这么做的
as I cook for my father-in-law.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,240
# 待会大料跟排骨跟猪肉特别配
Star anise and pork ribs are a power couple.

72
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,440
# 然后烧出来肉的香味特别浓
This is dish is going to have a rich aroma later on.

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
# 吹吧反正我和小魏待会儿也得尝
Stop bragging, Xiao Wei and I will try it.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,040
# 待会儿您尝一下就知道了
Be my guest and help yourselves.

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,640
# 其实做好一道菜 这就是细节
Truth be told, it's the details that determine whether a dish is successful

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,840
# 对 得学会
Agreed.

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,720
# 好大料味基本上就出来了
Smells of star anise is spreading out.

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,120
# 搁一个排骨咱试试
Put one rib in.

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
# 油温低 稍微有点低
The temperature is a little bit low.

80
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,920
# 我是属于非专业 非专业选手
I am a non-professional player.

81
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,240
# 只能在家里边还能行做菜真不灵
Merely a home cook

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,160
# 老冯从事餐饮也将近二十年了
Lao Feng has been running his restaurant business for nearly 20 years now.

83
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,520
# 因为炸这排骨一定要注意观察
We need to pay attention to the ribs.

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,960
# 外边能起一层焦焦的皮就可以了
It is ready when there is a layer of brown crust on the rib.

85
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,600
# 咱先放在这锅里
Just leave the ribs here.

86
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,440
# 这油温还是有点低
The oil temperature is still a bit low.

87
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,640
# 油温你知道什么时候下么我告诉你
Do you know when is the best time to put in the ribs?

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,000
# 稍微冒有烟的时候
When the oil is almost smoking

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
# 油温上烟的时候合适
The suitable timing is when there is smoke on top of the oil.

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,680
# 一下抱住水分锁定
Hot oil helps lock the moisture inside the meat.

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,640
# 如果你要像这种温度下去
If the meat was deep fried in low oil temperature,

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
# 它就成熬了 成浸了
It becomes a stew in the oil.

93
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,160
# 它水分锁不住
Meat juice can’t be locked in.

94
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,720
# 再烧一会
Keeping heating up.

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
# 因为你不是为了给它炸熟
The purpose of deep-frying is not to fully cook the meat

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,440
# 你为了锁住（水分）定型
but to set the shape and lock meat juicy inside.

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,240
# 可以下了 没问题这是这感觉
It’s ready to deep-fry now. No worries.

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,800
# 看见没有 这才叫炸
See? This is deep-fried ribs.

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,320

100
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,080
# 这温度将近有二百
The temperature is nearly 200 degrees.

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,360
# 不要扒拉它 漂起来就出锅
Don’t stir them, just wait until they float.

102
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
# 看这大料的颜色
Look at the colour of this star anise.

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,200
# 基本上这油温是可以的
The temperature is good.

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,080
# 冯爷说了看看大料的颜色
Sir Feng said take a look at the colour of the star anise.

105
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,160
# 好嘞 这排骨就可以了
Great! Done.

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,200
# 这颜色好看 非常好
The colour is fantastic and beautiful. Amazing.

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,960
# 层次感很强是吧
And different layers.

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
# 三叔得为老冯服务
San Shu should serve Lao Feng.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,960
# 三叔这手劲还是可以的
San Shu has very good strength.

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,280

111
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,320
# 咱们这锅 就就着这个锅
And then, with the work...

112
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,120
# 然后咱们炝一下锅
And then, we need to stir-fry the ribs,

113
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,080
# 来点底油 有点像炒糖的感觉
Add some cooking oil, it seems like stir-frying sugar.

114
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,280
# 油太多了 我再盛出一点油
Too much oil, let me take some oil out.

115
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,920
# 油还是多 没事他有他的玩法
Still too much, but no worries, he has tricks.

116
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,880
# 咱还学学 各家有各家的高招
Time to learn. Different chef, different techniques.

117
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,960
# 一定要留出来点 二次加糖
Keep some of them aside, and add sugar again.

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,240
# 待会咱们调味用 小火炒糖
These are for seasoning later on. Fry the sugar over low heat.

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
# 这糖可千万别炒过了
Don't overcook it.

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,640
# 不能跟咱们炒糖色是的
It’s not like normal caramel.

121
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,240
# 就要它糖色的金黄色
We need to cook the sugar until it's amber not brown.

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
# 这个炒法不加水么师弟
Does this method require water, Shi Di (a way to call junior fellow apprentice in Chinese)?

123
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
# 我是从来不加的
Never for me.

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,680
# 他是油炒法
He makes caramel with oil.

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,200
# 有水炒 有混合油水炒 有油炒
Different methods: caramel with water, with oil and with both.

126
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,160
# 三种炒法
There are three ways.

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,960
# 其实这也是糖醋排骨的关键点
This is another key point.

128
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,400
# 这糖还不能炒过了
Caramel should be just right,

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,200
# 很要火候 过了成糖色了
we need to focus on the temperature, otherwise it’ll be overcooked.

130
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
# 这个排骨肯定好吃师叔
These ribs must be delicious Uncle.

131
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
# 你知道为什么
Do you know why?

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,200
# 我觉得这种烹调技法 非常传统
I think this cooking method is very traditional.

133
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,040
# 他等于是炒完糖色以后
After the caramel is ready,

134
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,360
# 用糖跟醋去焖 焖酥了这种排骨
ribs will be braised with sugar and vinegar.

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
# 所以这个人要小心 他给咱俩埋雷呢
We'd better keep on the right side of him, his words mean more than what he says.

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,760
# 我是一个非专业 我没有刚强牛
I am not professional. Gang Qiang is better.

137
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,960
# 其实我师弟干的全都是专业的活
Actually my Shi Di does all the professional work.

138
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,880
# 看这个糖就是金黄色就可以了
Ok, it turns into gold colour now.

139
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,160
# 你要炒嫩一点也可以
If you want, you don’t need to cook them completely,

140
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,560
# 因为你后边翻锅的时候它还在变色
Because it will continue to cook and change colour when you stir-fry the ribs later.

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,160
# 颜色漂亮  这个是最关键的
Beautiful colour. This is the key point.

143
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,800
# 然后把蒜也放进去
Add all garlic in.

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,160
# 糖醋排骨离不开蒜
Sweet-sour pork ribs and garlic match perfectly.

145
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,040
# 它把蒜的香味抱进去
Pork ribs will absorb the garlic flavour.

146
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,920
# 这时候蒜的香味出来了
Now the garlicky flavor is brought out.

147
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,560
# 然后再放姜
Add in some ginger.

148
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,480
# 姜是去腥 提香 增加肉的香味
Ginger can remove meat odor, and enhance the aroma

149
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,280
# 你看姜和蒜的香味混合到一起
Ginger and garlic are now mixed up.

150
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,160
# 一定要这三个要分出层次来
Layers of flavours are important.

151
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
# 这颜色多漂亮是吧
Fantastic colour.

152
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,040
# 葱段 先煸炒 要有耐心
Spring onion. Stir-fry the spring onion, be patient.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,800
# 因为这个 你看最后咱收汁的时候
We are going to reduce the sauce at the end.

154
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,920
# 要收到 跟这个汁儿一样
The final consistency should look exactly like this.

155
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,200
# 叫怎么进锅 怎么出锅
We call it, "It goes out of the wok in the same way it went in"

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080

157
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,840
# 这葱味也出来了
I can smell spring onion now.

158

# 这时候最关键的一步 这个醋

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,280
# 烹下去 整个儿倒
Pour it in.

161
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
# 火稍微小点
Turn the heat down a little bit.

162
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,280
# 要是说大火一烹 糖醋味就出来了
Sweet and sour flavour tends to be amplified by high heat.

163
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,000
# 这个小亮子跟谁学的啊
Where did you learn it?

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,560
# 跟三叔学的
From San shu.

165
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,680
# 咱们点点盐 这盐千万不要多
Sprinkle a little bit salt.

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,920
# 因为咱们有底口了
As we have massaged the ribs before with salt.

167

168
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,680
# 就要它这味儿 借味

169

# 这时候把这糖再放进去 二次加糖

170
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
# 网友们看见没有

171
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,400
# 二次加糖是调糖和醋的味儿
Adding sugar again is to flavour the dish and balance the sweetness and sourness.

172
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,160
# 还加水吗 我就要用您一点黄酒
Do you need more water? I need some yellow rice wine.

# 现在咱们的排骨 猪肉都挺嫩

# 如果糖醋排骨要晾凉了 更好吃
It would taste more delicious if you let it cool first.

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,040
# 这一步要把三叔的黄酒
This step is to use San Shu’s yellow rice wine.

177
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,440
# 给它做一下稀释

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
# 但是我做糖醋排骨我爱用镇江醋
But I love Zhenjiang Vinegar for sweet and sour ribs.

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,920
# 镇江香醋

180
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200

# 今天咱们家没有  就这凑活了
We don’t have Zhenjiang vinegar at home. Just deal with it.

182
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960

183
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,880
# 这个盖必须得要盖上来
Lid on.

184
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,840
# 咱把火调的小一点 先入味后收汁
Lower the heat. Let the flavor penetrate the meat first before reducing the sauce.

185
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,600
# 咱们现在有十五分钟
After 15 mins,

186
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,160
# 然后咱们开大火 开始收汁
Heat up to reduce the sauce now.

187
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,680
# 把所有的料头取出来 出品漂亮
Remove garlic, ginger and other aromatics. We need fancy presentation.

# 最起码讲究点 这葱也好吃
Agree with fancy presentation. And spring onion tastes good.

189

# 这回的醋香就全出来了

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
# 这个已经行了 你看这汁
It’s ready. Take a look at the sauce.
